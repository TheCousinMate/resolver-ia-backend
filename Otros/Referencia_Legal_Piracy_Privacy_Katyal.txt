I begin by surmising some of the basic assumptions that are both descriptively and aspirationally present in property ownership , KATYAL PRIVACY VS. PIRACY and then argue that the architecture of cyberspace has destabilized the preexisting balance between privacy and property by eliminating the material conditions that permit the exercise of spatial privacy . Unlike property ownership in real space , which presupposes a degree of privacy by virtue of material seclusion , the public and private nature of property in cyberspace\u2014coupled with its immense digital mobility and decentralization\u2014often come into conflict with one another , interacting within a sphere of confusing uncertainty . Instead of material seclusion , individuals operate under an assumption of their expressive anonymity , which significantly expands potential in cyberspace . At the same time , however , information harvesting is rampant , a factor which alters any presumption of balance between privacy and property in cyberspace . Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the context of peer-to-peer transmissions . Here , I describe how peer-to-peer transmissions have enabled the rapid transmission of content , such as music , film and other types of copyrighted material , facilitating a crisis of intellectual property . But it has also created a sort of crisis for privacy and security , as well . By making one \u2019 s online activities , identities , and preferences transparently visible , peer-to-peer frameworks create a culture of panopticism by other This culture of panopticism , in turn , enables a variety of entities\u2014government , private individuals , and copyright owners\u2014to exploit the power of peer-to-peer frameworks to develop an increasingly invasive system of surveillance to guard against piracy . individuals . In the second section , I turn to the origins of piracy surveillance , and describe the myriad ways in which private entities have successfully monitored transmissions in cyberspace to control uses of their copyrighted materials . Following the DMCA , I argue , court opinions have unwittingly facilitated the creation of a private regime wherein copyright owners and intermediaries engage in self-help surveillance of consumers . Piracy surveillance regimes take on three basic types , each displaying varying degrees of unilateral aggression : monitoring , which involves the use of automated systems to search for protected material ; management , which involves a host of actions taken in real space and cyberspace to limit certain uses of cultural products ;"}]}

Regimes of panoptic publication have especially deleterious ( indeed chilling ) effects on creations that rely on fair use for their validity , particularly transformative works.9 As I will show , piracy surveillance carries the potential to transform the nature of copyright from a liability-based regime into a regime that governs the creation of all cultural products in cyberspace , both illegitimate and legitimate . This affects both speaker and audience in three primary ways : first , piracy surveillance enables ISPs to monitor and record the activities of their subscribers , thereby affecting the autonomy , anonymity , and privacy in cyberspace ; second , piracy surveillance overdeters copyright infringement , affecting both the expression and fair use of non-offenders ; and third , piracy surveillance affects the audience \u2019 s ability to access information without interference . individuals enjoy This paper takes the view that this conflict between privacy and piracy is important not just because it showcases a new , overlooked mode of surveillance , but also because it demonstrates the need to resolve conflicts between them in ways that are reflective\u2014and protective\u2014of the relationship between modern technology and personal I conclude , therefore , by pointing out the need for greater public oversight over these private realms of surveillance , and suggest a number of ways in which we can envision a more protective sphere for individual autonomy in cyberspace .

Informational privacy is rooted in the Fourth Amendment \u2019 s protection from unreasonable searches and seizures , as well as the conception of privacy outlined by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis in their famous 1890 article in the Harvard Law Review,12 where they used the phrase \u201c right to privacy \u201d to denote a constellation of different interests , most of which involved the right not to have personal information exposed to the general public.13 Jonathan Zittrain , What the Publish r Can Teach the Patient : Intellectual Property and Privacy in an Era of Trusted Privication , 52 STAN .

This no Body has any right to but himself. \u201d 18 Lockean notions of property in one \u2019 s person are inextricably linked to the protection of privacy .

The law , too , has embraced this view , noting that both entitlements are equally necessary in the law : one can not exist without the other.37 In real space , for example , property law , architecture , and the strong protections afforded by the Fourth Amendment are able to strike an important balance between privacy and property , as reflected in the substantial the Fourth Amendment that required some evidence of a trespassory invasion . This tendency also reflected the traditional , oft- repeated presumption that \u201c a man \u2019 s house is his castle , \u201d 38 which formed a critical cornerstone in the development of the unreasonable search and seizure jurisprudence.39 In the early eighteenth century , for example , the protection of property rights served as a reasonable proxy for privacy interests : Proof of trespass on one \u2019 s private property , for example , was necessary to establish the search and seizure liability of government agents.40 Early Fourth Amendment jurisprudence further jurisprudence stemming from Id . 37 See Rakas v.

The question was whether this storage and a dissemination constitutional right to privacy.48 In an insightful opinion , Justice Stevens deftly characterized the growing case law concerning privacy into two different kinds of interests , one informational and one substantive .

Unlike real space , where architecture and simple geography precluded neighbors and the government from peering in on each other \u2019 s activities , today , the architecture of the Internet ( quite unlike its brick and than prevents , mortar informational invasions.67 counterpart ) facilitates , rather in To begin with , the changing architecture of cyberspace plays a vital and active role facilitating consumer surveillance\u2014architectural elements like borders and fences have extremely different capabilities when they are protecting information , rather than tangible goods.68 For example , most content on the Internet\u2014music , text , video , and other fixed media\u2014tends to be \u201c served \u201d from a central system that responds to requests from a user . The user , or \u201c client \u201d requests information , or content , from a server ; the server then transmits the information to the user.69 In this model , visitors to a Web site do not interact with each other.70 Information simply passes from one entity to another , and the recipients of the information do not connect.71 Consumers connect to the Web 67 See Lawrence Lessig , The Archiecture ofPrivacy , 1 VAND .

In contrast , a peer-to-peer framework essentially erases the hierarchical division between client and server , thus turning the idea of a network of Internet governance on its head.77 A peer-to-peer model creates a mode of communication that treats each machine as a separate and equal entity in the sharing of Clay Shirky , Listening to Napster , in PEER-TO-PEER : HARNESSING THE POWER OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES 21 , 35 ( Andy Oram ed. , 2001 ) [ hereinafter PEER-TO-PEER ] .

As a result , privacy and security in cyberspace depend most often on consumer sophistication and technical knowledge , rather than a simple preference for seclusion . Consider the implications of a program called \u201c Desk Swap. \u201d Desk Swap is a program that makes a person \u2019 s online desktop visible to others across the Internet .

Given the extent to which individuals often place personal information on their desktops , the possibility of unintended exposure is enormous . Yet the point of the program is not to reveal others \u2019 personal information ; there is another objective .

THE DIGITAL PERSONA AS PROPERTY As I have argued , the permeable boundaries between private and public space clearly alter the relationship between intellectual property and informational privacy . Here , Arendt \u2019 s distinction between the private sphere\u2014as invisible , hidden , and full of depth\u2014and the comparatively more shallow public sphere , offers us little solace . Many individuals attach privacy expectations to their activities , identities , and expressions in public space , particularly where the sharing of information is concerned , even if the law fails to validate them . Here , intellectual property principles play an inherently contradictory role : on one hand , they serve as a theoretical foundation for viewing the collection of consumer information as property that can ( and should ) be treated like any other commodity ; on the other hand , the very same principles also theoretically justify granting consumers greater control over their personal information.104 This tension between intellectual property as a protective foundation for consumers , on one hand\u2014and data harvesters , on the other\u2014creates an added , and underlying , conflict regarding the propertization of personal information . On one hand , as Rochelle Dreyfuss has pointed out , intellectual property protections exist so that companies can assert private control over personal information used publicly , such as the copyright protection afforded to databases.105 Yet , today , intellectual property is now being considered as a framework for individuals to assert rights over private activities conducted publicly\u2014such as"}]}

In doing so , the court drew several conclusions that extended property rights in the information to harvesters , rather than to the individuals themselves . The court first distinguished DoubleClick \u2019 s property rights to the cookies in questions from the privacy rights of the parties , subjugating the latter to the former . In stark contrast to the principles set forth by both Locke and Warren and Brandeis , the court \u2019 s opinion suggested that an individual \u2019 s personal identifying information is the property of the company that harvests it , not of the consumer .

Indeed , the confused and somewhat fearful way both public and private entities have file sharing demonstrates an responded to peer-to-peer interests between anti-piracy interesting convergence of advocates and harvesters of personal information . The end result is a regime of surveillance that quietly mimics regimes of consumer monitoring : here , intellectual property owners have sought to find ways to protect their works from unauthorized use , thereby creating a new mode of monitoring that crosses the boundaries between commercial self-interest and prurient intrusion on informational privacy . And , just as undesirably , such regimes have led both public and private entities to respond even more forcefully than necessary , seeking to erode not only the peer-to-peer networks that have sprouted throughout the Net , but the protection of informational privacy and identity . 163 Doubleclick , Inc. , at 520 . YALE JOURNAL OF LAW & TECHNOLOGY 2004-2005 In the previous section , I argued that perceptions of informational privacy and anonymity in cyberspace have inevitably led individuals to perceive a mantle of anonymity that they might not enjoy in real life.164 Add to this another element : peer-to-peer file-sharing programs that permit the exchange of copyrighted content from each other \u2019 s hard drives.165 Obviously , the seduction\u2014and danger\u2014of the peer-to-peer world is that it enables the seemingly anonymous and widespread distribution of content , such as text .

The court rejected Kennedy \u2019 s assertions that Road Runner trampled on his Fourth Amendment rights when it divulged his subscriber information to the government because he had failed to demonstrate an \u201c objectively reasonable legitimate expectation of privacy in his subscriber information , \u201d since he had activated his computer \u2019 s file sharing mechanism.317 The Kennedy court analyzed the privacy issues Kennedy raised by turning to the test articulated in Katz v.

In analyzing the second question , the Court later opined that \u201c \u2018 [ the ] test of legitimacy is not whether the individual chooses to conceal assertedly \u201c private \u201d activity , \u2019 but instead \u2018 whether the government \u2019 s intrusion infringes upon the personal and societal values protected by the Fourth Amendment. \u2019 \u201d California v.

Kennedy demonstrates the discontinuity of expectations of privacy and anonymity ; a person might share information under a subjective expectation of anonymity ( supported , perhaps by the ISP \u2019 s assurances of consumer privacy ) , even though a court might reach the opposite conclusion.321 In sum , under Katz , it appears unclear whether a person can legally possess a reasonable expectation of anonymity and engage in file sharing at the same time , even though , practically speaking , many individuals do so quite readily . The court suggested that Kennedy \u2019 s use and activation of a file sharing mechanism essentially meant that files contained within his hard drive could be considered public\u2014not only his numerical subscription information , but the actual content of his files as well.322 Currently , the DMCA , as it is written , contains no protection for anonymous speakers in the face of accusations of infringement.323 And , as the mistaken examples in the previous section demonstrate , the risk of exposure is not limited to clear- cut cases alone , but to anyone who may be caught within the panoptic Web of copyright enforcement .

PIRACY The Office of Copyrights continued to hold this view throughout the years of legislative revision.351 As the original Sony court observed , this position developed in part from a concern about invasion of the individual \u2019 s privacy in the home : \u201c As Ms. Ringer testified , home recording simply can not be controlled . Nobody is going into anyone \u2019 s home to prevent it . . . . Of course , not all activity is made legal by virtue of occurring in a private home . Congress can constitutionally legislate against some activity which may occur in the home , but doing so necessarily requires caution . Here , legislative history shows that , in balance , Congress did not find that protection of copyright holders \u2019 rights over reproduction of their works was worth the privacy and enforcement problems which restraint of home-use recording would create. \u201d 352 Looking back , it is resoundingly clear that the advent of technology has changed this original determination , particularly where the DMCA is concerned . Today , DRM technologies and other forms of piracy surveillance routinely govern and restrain one \u2019 s at-home activities and usage of cultural products . DRM allows for the privatization of copyright enforcement ; it eliminates judicial oversight and precludes an adversarial forum for the consumer \u2019 s protection.353 These systems operate automatically and panoptically , without the benefit of a complaint , response , third-party determination , or even a modicum of judicial involvement.354 In other words , copyright enforcement has encroached , and integrated itself , into the home . 3 . INTERFERENCE A final method , significantly more unilaterally aggressive than the others , involves the use of smart agents that interdict transmissions .

A peer-to-peer connection is simply disabled , rather than identities recorded and exposed . But it is easy to imagine the likelihood of copyright owners creating other programs that do carry these risks.366 One potential avenue , for example , involves the spreading of \u201c snitch \u201d files that would actively collect information , such as the identity of the infringer , a list"}]}

Piracy surveillance techniques are developed and purchased by industries that seek to realize significant profits by inventing ways to deter and detect infringement .

Moreover , because so much piracy surveillance takes place outside of the boundaries of government regulation , the \u201c private \u201d regime of piracy surveillance will likely be rewarded with another , equally protective individual self-help regime by individuals : encryption . Encryption creates a kind of \u201c robust anonymity \u201d that can sever the link between certain types of personal information and the person to whom it relates.370 Obviously , encryption is a type of privacy-enhancing technology that aids both law abiding and law evading citizens . But , as applied to the piracy surveillance scenario , particularly in the wake of Aimster , encryption will have distributional consequences on the nature of legitimate speech in cyberspace . Risk-averse individuals who are fearful of detection from copyright enforcers ( either because they are actually pirating materials or are treading on a \u201c grey area \u201d of fair use ) will be encouraged to encrypt their messages or files to escape detection.371 As such ,"}]}

In some circumstances , where files represent perfect replications of copyrighted songs , the use of encryption might be desirable , because encryption prevents use by the general public , thereby reducing the number of infringing transactions . On the other hand , where the file represents something that arguably falls within a \u201c grey area \u201d of fair use ( like the song in question in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music ) ,372 risk-averse creators might opt for encryption to avoid detection in cyberspace . This narrows the scope of the audience reached for the As Jerry Kang explains , encryption uses a cryptographic algorithm and a key to encode a message into ciphertext . The intended recipient uses a key to decode the message back into its original form . If the cryptographic algorithm is strong , and the key properly selected and kept secret , it is infeasible for an unauthorized party to intercept the ciphertext and decrypt it back into plaintext . See Kang , supra note 125 , at 1242 .

Moreover , as Professor Jerry Kang points out , the legality of some encryption methods is often uncertain.373 As peer-to- peer jurisprudence suggests , information exchanges might get more privatized through encryption , but the more privatized these exchanges become , the more courts appear willing to require added degrees of surveillance and control . Consider the outcome of Aimster , which clearly suggested the need for software redesign to preclude encryption , and to encourage consumer monitoring . The presence of encryption , in that case , served to highlight the software developers \u2019 own \u201c willful blindness , \u201d thereby opening up the doors to contributory liability .

III . TOWARDS A REGIME OF PANOPTIC PUBLICATION Part II outlined a number of ways in which intellectual property owners have privately sought to enforce copyright restrictions on cultural products and to detect unauthorized uses of their products . This result has significant effects on privacy , freedom of speech , and copyright itself\u2014particularly where expression falls within \u201c grey areas \u201d of the fair use doctrine . As the protection and control of intellectual property expands , the protection of informational privacy shrinks . As a result , speech suffers .

Or , worse yet , imagine the copyright owner was capable of recording your activities and curtailing them if it deemed them to constitute \u201c infringement. \u201d Where would your rights lie , particularly with respect to your freedom of expression or right to defend your activities from scrutiny ? One risk-averse to prevent response might be embarrassing or unwanted intervention from copyright owners . You might , then , erase detailed references to cultural products that resembles in your writing , avoid using copyrighted speech , maybe even avoid certain forms of commentary , parody , fan fiction , collage , or sampling entirely . The eventual result would be a gradual chilling of creative behavior ; the constant , silent , assertion of surveillance for infringement might eventually deter you from speaking at all . to curb your behavior language information This section argues that the nature of copyright has become fundamentally altered by the use of piracy surveillance in a regime of \u201c panoptic publication. \u201d Under this regime , anyone who publishes in cyberspace \u2013 whether a commentary on a particular book , or a work that draws upon existing work \u2013 can be subjected to an extrajudicial determination of infringement ."}]}

I am grateful to Fred Von Lohmann for these suggested examples . KATYAL PRIVACY VS. PIRACY between control over private ownership and expression in order to create incentives for more speech creation . Yet piracy surveillance eviscerates this balance between control and expression , leading to an inescapable logic of vigilantism . Instead of protecting the creation of cultural products , piracy surveillance has transformed copyright into a regime where copyright owners are legally empowered with a variety of means to panoptically identify , classify , and threaten potential pirates ; and , in doing so , are made capable of controlling the public \u2019 s access to cultural products to an unprecedented degree , thereby reducing the incentives for further speech and creation . A. PRIVACY AND AUTONOMY The underlying logic behind piracy surveillance is inextricably tied to real space principles , suggesting that intellectual property is equivalent , in both form and content , to other types of properties in real space . Thus , proponents of piracy surveillance point out that comparable measures of legalized self-help ( like the right of repossession or defense of property ) are traditionally available to property owners in real space ; thus , the same should be available to intellectual property owners in cyberspace.376 This is true : A property owner is permitted , under the law , to take certain actions to recover immunity from stolen possessions , and trespassing on others \u2019 land for that purpose . Yet there is a crucial difference between such strategies in real space as opposed to cyberspace : Self-help methods in real space are traditionally premised on maintaining , not destroying , preexisting boundaries between private and public space . For this reason , self-help strategies in real space reify , rather than erode , the architecturally-created balance between spatial protections for privacy and protection of property discussed in Part I of this Article . Indeed , both the common law and the U.C.C . have extended self-help allowances to property owners with a few important caveats : both bodies of law limit the right to enter private property in order to repossess items to those is granted some 376 See Email from Alec French , Minority Counsel , House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts , the Internet , and Intellectual Property"}]}

KATYAL PRIVACY VS. PIRACY property is not real property , and a number of particularized rules govern the use of intellectual property . A host of statutory exceptions ( including fair use ) limit an owner \u2019 s exclusive control over intellectual property.383 Moreover , self-help analogies from real space often fail to consider the costs of such invasion on a non-offending individual . Instead of serving as a passive constraint to protect from invasions of real property ( like a lock or fence ) , some piracy surveillance techniques ( like the use of smart agents for monitoring ) are instituted without probable cause or notice to the user and carry the potential to eviscerate one \u2019 s anonymity.384 In sum , the premise of piracy surveillance suggests the need to revisit the importance of recognizing the cost of technologies of invasion on consumer autonomy and access to information . Here is where the panoptic metaphor is so prescient . Constant monitoring alters online behavior in inescapable ways \u2013 one \u2019 s speech , surfing habits , use of cultural products , and even identity itself .

The Verizon trial court echoed this point , observing , where an ISP subscriber \u201c opens his computer to permit others , through peer-to-peer file sharing , to download materials from that computer , it is hard to understand just what privacy expectation he or she has after essentially opening the computer to the world. \u201d 388 But this point fails to consider the other policy concerns that turn on the importance of protecting in non-offending from unwanted surveillance individuals Lawrence"}]}

Section 512 ( h ) merely allows a private copyright owner to obtain the identity of an alleged copyright infringer in order to protect constitutionally-recognized rights in creative works ; it does not even directly seek or restrain the underlying expression ( the sharing of copyrighted material ) . Thus the DMCA does not regulate protected expression or otherwise permit prior restraint of protected speech . It only requires production of the identity of one who has engaged YALE JOURNAL OF LAW & TECHNOLOGY 2004-2005 in unprotected conduct \u2013 sharing copyrighted material on the Internet.412 This observation , at first glance , is rhetorically powerful , particularly as applied to the facts in Verizon . But the statement also overlooks the interplay of three other elements : ( 1 ) the gatekeeper role of the ISP , which faces the threat of contributory infringement if it does not act immediately to silence the offensive conduct ; ( 2 ) the potential for strategic motives of a copyright owner , who may be tempted to file notices for spurious reasons ; and ( 3 ) the fact that the subpoena provisions are not limited solely to individuals who upload copyrighted songs ( an admittedly clearer issue of infringement ) , but apply to anyone who offers , obtains , or creates allegedly infringing material on the Internet . Since the words of the DMCA permit a preliminary unveiling of identity , Section 512 can give rise to serious due process concerns , for the accused herself as well as the ISP , if the subpoenaed party lacks the ability to object.413 As Professors A.

The DMCA section , as it is written , empowers anyone who alleges \u201c unauthorized \u201d use of a copyrighted work to obtain a subpoena with the identity of any Internet user \u2013 without the institution of ongoing or anticipated litigation , or even notice to the user herself.419 Moreover , piracy surveillance themselves , do not demonstrate a predisposition towards the kind of discretionary non-enforcement that is typically demonstrated by public prosecutors and law enforcers.420 Instead , piracy surveillance methods are calibrated to be overbroad by design in order to deter the widest possible breadth of infringement . in and of techniques , Returning to Polinsky and Shavell \u2019 s point , the problem of anonymity , coupled with the low standard of proof , lays the groundwork for the possibility of \u201c overfishing \u201d for violators .

In sum , piracy surveillance techniques also fail to consider two significant costs to non-offenders : overdeterrence of speech and evisceration of fair use . These two elements , taken together , paradoxically convert copyright from a regime that governs the illegitimate uses of private properties into a regime that governs all speech and expression in cyberspace , even when it is only tangentially related to the copyright owner in question . The effect of this transformation can not be understated \u2013 both with respect to copyright law , as well as the nature of cyberspace itself . To understand its effects , it is helpful to recall that fair use cures a market failure in copyright that may be created because the possibility of consensual bargain may have broken down in some way , either because transaction costs are too high or because agreement is otherwise impossible.423 Piracy surveillance , however , eclipses judicial enforcement of fair use , because a private entity \u2019 s determination under the DMCA circumvents access"}]}

This line may be fairly easy to draw if we are considering the liability of someone who is uploading hundreds of files of copyrighted music ( something that courts generally agree constitutes infringement ) , but is much harder to draw in cases that involve someone who is downloading music for parody , fair use , space shifting , or transformative purposes . Uncertain legal standards , as John Calfee and Richard Craswell remind us , deter socially desirable behavior through overcompliance.426 In these circumstances , an extrajudicial determination of infringement is efficient , quick , but often prone to mistake , thus laying the groundwork for the uncertainty that may motivate an over-deterrence of speech .

IV . BALANCING PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ENFORCEMENT inherent conflicts with another . In cyberspace , intellectual property and privacy are at an impasse . There is no way out \u2013 the enforcement of each area faces Throughout the development of copyright in cyberspace , intellectual property rights have slowly and quietly expanded to take precedence over the privacy and expressive rights of ordinary citizens . Part of this is due to the expansion of property rights over areas of intangible information and the absence of strong legislative protections of informational privacy . Yet , part of it is also due to a failure among lawmakers and judges to conceptualize a deeper relationship between property and privacy ; there is a current tendency , shared by many , to separate intellectual property rights from privacy and to create a hierarchical relationship between the two . In other words , the law has displayed a persistent failure to recognize that expansions of control of intellectual property cause tradeoffs in other areas of consumer protection \u2013 particularly where privacy is concerned . As a result , we have created a world in which the property rights of copyright owners are valued over the liberty , property , and privacy rights of others , suggesting that those principles are somehow less valuable than those involving commercial self- protection.429 Today , even in the wake of Verizon , the rivalry between intellectual property and privacy persists , even though the factual scenario has changed .

Consequently , the risk of implicating non-offenders within the panoptic snare of piracy surveillance raises the danger of silencing speech and expression in cyberspace . Thus , rather than property rights taking precedence over privacy , this section will argue that the three rights in question \u2013 privacy , property , speech \u2013 should be equally valued and protected , rather than treated as stand-alone regimes . An adequate starting point , then , is to reexamine copyright \u2019 s relationship to privacy . Indeed , the great irony of this situation is not the intractability of the conflict between privacy and intellectual property in cyberspace , but the inability of legislators to fashion a solution that squares with other constitutional values of property , personhood , and autonomy under the DMCA . Thus , under my proposed solution , the law would attempt to reconcile these values with copyright enforcement by creating a series of entitlements based on the need for personal protection and anonymity in the face of piracy surveillance.430 As this Article has suggested , piracy surveillance implicates a curious type of private ordering that merges the boundaries of private and public . While the standards governing copyright infringement , fair use , and the DMCA were drafted by Congress the actual implementation of these rules often gets left to the amorphous and decidedly variant motives of copyright owners . Moreover , in most copyright cases , the Constitution rarely makes an appearance if both parties are private , non-state entities.431 However , under the state action doctrine , constitutional guarantees can limit the activities of a private party if the conduct in question is entwined with traditional state functions , judiciary ) , ( and the 430 See GANDY , supra note 91 , at 235 . 431 See John R.

Congress drafted the relevant provisions , and a judicial body enforces them after a cursory examination ; indeed , the unveiling of a person \u2019 s identity is performed by an ISP pursuant to a court order.433 Moreover , much of these issues seem particularly poignant in light of New York Times v. Sullivan,434 in which the Supreme Court overturned a libel decision regarding a paid advertisement that criticized a Montgomery city official .

The property rights of the original copyright owner can be used to trample the copyright/fair use rights of other creators . As I have suggested , piracy surveillance involves a clear delegation to the private citizen to determine what constitutes infringement and what constitutes fair use . As a result , the DMCA creates a silent web of public and private interdependence , functions are virtually ministerial , and private determinations are largely adjudicative . Given the substantial risk of strategic enforcement of infringement , increasing encroachment on privacy protections is to ensure some level of hybridity between public and private enforcement . in which public the only way to balance the As I have suggested throughout this piece , laws protecting intellectual property must be harmonized with other , mostly constitutional , values . Here , the Fourth Amendment could serve as a guide , particularly since its jurisprudence has 432 Id . at 593 ( citing Flagg Bros. , Inc. v.

YALE JOURNAL OF LAW & TECHNOLOGY 2004-2005 historically sought to reconcile the tension between protecting the interests of the public with individual civil liberties . Following this view , pre-Internet laws that flow from the mantle of the Fourth Amendment , such as the Privacy Protection Act ( \u201c PPA \u201d ) can offer a path to follow in creating some much-needed balance between privacy and intellectual property . The PPA requires a special subpoena when First Amendment interests in news reporting might be affected by an ongoing investigation . The origins of the PPA echo of the same concerns raised by piracy surveillance strategies today . In 1971 , a demonstration at Stanford University Hospital turned into a violent clash between the participants and police . The Stanford Daily , a campus newspaper , managed to photograph a number of participants in the demonstration.436 Two days afterward , it published a series of photographs of the clash between the police and the demonstrators . After it published the photographs , the police obtained a search warrant to seize material that might constitute activity under the investigation.437 Hence , at Stanford Daily , the police searched wastebaskets and rummaged through photographic negatives.438 The event so incensed the employees at Daily that they filed suit , contending that the First Amendment barred the use of a search warrant under circumstances where the entity in question is a news gatherer not implicated in the criminal conduct .

Thus , if a copyright owner wanted to determine the identity of a person who might be transmitting or downloading materials for infringing purposes , the DMCA , like the PPA , could also require a similar subpoena that raises the standard of judicial oversight.445 This provision should track the PPA in several major respects . First , following the PPA , the DMCA could establish that it is illegal for private piracy surveillance measures to force an ISP to seize or silence expression that falls under fair use or First Amendment protection without first requesting a court order . By making immediate seizures of protected material illegal , the proposed provision would shift the cost of mistaken surveillance and silencing to the copyright owner or bounty hunter . Moreover , by raising the costs of mistaken detection , and creating greater incentives to reduce their occurrence , this provision would also ensure greater protection for fair use and First Amendment interests . Thus , the proposed amendment would require copyright owners to request a preliminary injunction or specific court order before asking an ISP to take down material , remove the subscriber \u2019 s access , or disclose a person \u2019 s identity . It could also provide for compensation in the event of a mistaken determination or disclosure . following Second , the DMCA , its own notice-and- takedown provision , could provide for a requirement of notice to be given to the end user prior to disclosure of identity , and could provide for specific procedures to challenge the disclosure of one \u2019 s identity in the event of an asserted fair use defense . Some may argue that the outcome of Verizon accomplishes many of these goals by essentially requiring the filing of actual litigation prior to disclosure of the alleged infringer \u2019 s identity . Yet , I would recommend that future courts go further than the Verizon court did , by also integrating the DMCA subpoena procedure with a constitutional concern for anonymity . Thus , just as the 445 Moreover , even though piracy surveillance , at present , involves private actors , a DMCA notice is signed off by a district"}]}

Thus , state action is arguably present , from the moment of identity revelation to the moment where an ISP terminates the person \u2019 s access to the Internet or disables the account and the specter of criminal copyright infringement under the NET Act could easily provoke Fourth Amendment concerns . KATYAL PRIVACY VS. PIRACY PPA or other \u201c John Doe \u201d actions require more than enough evidence to withstand a motion to dismiss , the DMCA \u2019 s use of a subpoena should reflect the need for heightened standards of justification.446 In such situations where First Amendment concerns are triggered , the DMCA could require the immediate appealability of any proposed termination of access , the use of specially trained magistrates or marshals to carry out Internet searches , and other procedures that reflect a concern for individual civil liberties and expression , instead of the unilateral goal of protecting copyright above all else.447 Third , it bears noting that none of the anonymity issues are particularly new in the Internet context \u2013 many courts have already dealt with the question of how to protect the anonymity of a speaker in the face of a civil suit . In defamation cases , for example , courts have continued to develop methods to integrate First Amendment protections of anonymity with the need for legal resolution . Those methods easily apply to the DMCA subpoena provision . In one such case , for example , the New Jersey Superior Court set forth a stringent test for the disclosure of one \u2019 s identity , requiring the following elements : [ T ] he trial court should first require the plaintiff to undertake efforts to notify the anonymous posters that they are the subject of a subpoena or application for an order of disclosure , and withhold action to afford the fictitiously-named defendants a reasonable opportunity to file and serve opposition to the application .

The nature of this inquiry is therefore both substantive and procedural , but enables the speaker to remain protected from anonymous disclosure for spurious reasons . The solution I have outlined accomplishes three primary goals . First , the special subpoena provisions operate to raise the standard of proof to protect against spurious claims , and deter the \u201c overfishing \u201d scenario I have described in Part III . Second , the proposed burden-shifting and damage award provisions help to compensate wrongly accused infringers , thereby making piracy surveillance and meritless accusations more costly.449 Finally , there is another reason for the adoption of this test in piracy surveillance scenarios : the need to raise the standard of proof in DMCA subpoenas after Verizon . Traditional \u201c John Doe \u201d lawsuits require the presentation of enough evidence to withstand a motion to dismiss , whereas the Dendrite test goes a step further by requiring an additional level of scrutiny . The court observed that in cases that implicate First Amendment rights to anonymity , \u201c application of the motion-to-dismiss standard in isolation fails to provide a basis for an analysis and balancing of Dendrite \u2019 s request for disclosure in light of John Doe No . 3 \u2019 s competing right of anonymity in the exercise of his right of free speech. \u201d 450 Under the Dendrite test , those suspected of copyright infringement or other illegal acts would not receive extra protection behind the shield of anonymity , but 448 Dendrite , 775 A.2d at 760 . In this way , these procedures reflect similar concerns that are also governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 , which requires a lawyer to make a reasonable inquiry into the factual and legal grounds of any filed document .

Consequently , more process \u2013 a higher standard of proof , more judicial scrutiny , and the use of special subpoenas that embrace First Amendment values \u2013 is due . The answer is more judicial regulation over surveillance , not less , and more recognition of the value of anonymity to the marketplace of speech . One may argue that these solutions are still somewhat narrow in the sense that they protect the anonymous speaker alone , and fail to address the other types of monitoring I have addressed that involve DRM and interference . As I have shown , piracy surveillance also , problematically , unilaterally permits private copyright owners to interpret the rules governing copyright and to prevent their violation.451 Yet while the private copyright industry may be in the best position to invest in the technology to guard against and detect infringement , courts , not private entities , are in the best position to determine actual liability . To resolve these difficult scenarios , I propose the institution of alterations to the DMCA that seek to clarify the standard of fair use and help to ensure its protection from intrusion or evisceration by extrajudicial forms of surveillance . Here , the DMCA could also be revised to specify protection for the downloading of files containing small portions of copyrighted material ( e.g. , samples or film clips ) ; or files exchanged for educational purposes ; or even those that involve space shifting , commentary , parody , satire , or other purposes that have not yet 451 See also Julie E.

First , clarification helps to provide notice to future individuals of allowable activities in the face of new technologies , and it helps to clarify the many \u201c grey areas \u201d that often arise in difficult cases , like those listed above . This reduces the likelihood that individuals will engage in overcompliant behavior and avoid exercising their rights of freedom of speech and fair use . Second , clarification also enables all parties to recognize the importance of protecting an individual \u2019 s entitlement to fair use in the face of technologies that may individual manufacturers to carve out certain areas for allowable uses , and allows the individual to engage in those uses without risking liability .

Finally , defining the scope of fair use under the rubric of greater public oversight also advances the goal of due process.453 As this Article has suggested , piracy surveillance implicates serious due process concerns , particularly in the scenarios that I have outlined here : the risk of error is exceptionally high ; the is similarly likelihood of strategic , spurious enforcement pronounced ; and the standard to protect individuals from unwanted surveillance or extrajudicial determinations is exceptionally low . Moreover , the reach of piracy surveillance extends beyond actual copying of an existing work in its entirety , and could potentially reach the full gamut of expression on the Internet that fair use of copyrighted works ( like text files that use titles that correspond to copyrighted works , or written text that builds on prior implicates 452 See Julie Hilden , Should Universities C ack Down on File Swapping ? , at ( Mar . 4 , 2003 ) . r Traditionally , due process principles require courts to balance the government \u2019 s interest in using the procedures at issue , the risk of error in those procedures , and the private interest that is affected by the challenged procedures .

In short , the DMCA provisions govern much more than piracy \u2013 they govern the very essence of speech itself . As I have suggested , however , by clarifying the scope and fair use , and by precluding extrajudicial entitlement of determinations , we can come to a greater balance between privacy , property , and protection of expression . V. CONCLUSION In this Article , I have argued that our need to expand intellectual property protections must be reconciled with the existing protections for informational privacy and personal expression .

If we fail to strike the proper balance between intellectual property rights and privacy , our constitutional values of freedom of speech , the \u201c inviolate personality , \u201d and due process\u2014may be sacrificed . As this Article has suggested , both the protection of privacy and intellectual property are in crisis in cyberspace , permitting one to erode protections for the other .

For example , in the recent case of Thaler v Commissioner of Patents ( 2021 ) 160 IPR 72 ; [ 2021 ] FCA 879 , Beach J found that an \u201c artificial intelligence system or device \u201d can be an inventor of a patent , opining that \u201c [ w ] e are both created and create .

Originating in the 1950s , it is used loosely to refer to many different areas of computer science , such as machine learning , computer vision , natural language processing , speech recognition , robotics , expert systems , and planning and optimisation.2 The term \u2018 AI \u2019 commonly features in social and cultural debates in relation to ethics , risks , regulations , human rights and the future of humanity . AI is often understood as machines displaying human-like intelligence,3 yet that is not exactly accurate . Computers can perform various functions , but it does not mean they are \u2018 intelligent \u2019 or self-aware about their operation . It has also been argued that AI is not \u2018 artificial \u2019 because it is made from natural and human resources and depends on wider political and social structures.4 The terms \u2018 complementary \u2019 or \u2018 augmented \u2019 rather than \u2018 artificial \u2019 intelligence thus might be more suitable to describe the phenomenon if our goal is to create systems that solve problems that are difficult for humans rather than to duplicate human intelligence.5 The OECD originally defined an \u2018 AI system \u2019 as \u201c a machine-based system that can , for a given set of human-defined objectives , make predictions , recommendations , or decisions influencing real or virtual environments \u201d .

A recent Discussion Paper on Safe and Responsible AI in Australia , from the Commonwealth Department of Industry , Science and Resources , defines AI as \u201c engineered system that generates predictive outputs such as content , forecasts , recommendations or decisions for a given set of human-defined objectives or parameters without explicit programming \u201d , also noting that such systems are designed to operate with varying levels of automation.7 Due to the lack of a robust definition in Australia , the Asia-Pacific or internationally , the meaning of the term AI is contextual and may be defined differently in legal instruments,8 policy settings , or in contracts as part of a description of goods or services . Thus , legal requirements , contractual promises and dialogue that refer to AI should be understood and interpreted with reference to how the term is used in the specific context . 2.2 Expert Systems and Traditional Programming Expert systems apply knowledge provided by a human expert in a domain , such as law , to make predictions , recommendations or decisions based on that knowledge . A process in the expert system can be automated using a series of explicitly programmed steps such as so-called \u2018 if\u2026then\u2026 \u2019 rules or using a series of logical statements to create a \u2018 rule-set \u2019 . The former can be expressed visually in the form of a decision tree , where the available choices are referred to as \u2018 nodes \u2019 . Figure 1 is an example of a decision tree which determines whether a person can vote in an election in a country in which the only requirements are that the person is over the age of 18 and a citizen of that country . The latter , logic programming , allows computers to draw inferences from given facts and relations . 3 5 Toby Walsh et al , The Effective and Ethical Development of Artificial Intelligence : An Opportunity to Improve Our Wellbeing ( Report , July 2019 ) 14 .

Originally , writing rules in a language that a computer could implement required learning a programming language . The idea of an \u2018 expert system \u2019 was that the rules could be crafted by a domain expert ( for example , a lawyer ) who did not themselves have programming skills . There are now a range of \u2018 no-code \u2019 platforms that make it easy to \u2018 program \u2019 a computer to follow a particular process or reach conclusions based on a series of rules . Examples of such platforms include Austlii \u2019 s Datalex , Neota Logic , Realta Logic , Checkbox and Josef . Through these , and depending on the platform used , legal experts can use phrases , statements , arrows , drag-and-drop or drop-down menus or similar mechanisms to create a rule-set . Thus , a lawyer without programming skills can encode a decision tree , such as that shown above , or a series of logic propositions . 2.3 Automation Automation refers to the degree that a system acts without human intervention or control in some domain . The concept is neutral as to the technical means through which automation is achieved . Automation and AI are hence overlapping , but distinct , concepts . The operation of the term \u2018 automation \u2019 in practice can be illustrated with reference to the levels proposed by the Society of Automotive Engineers for automated vehicles ( see Figure 2 ) . The scale begins at zero ( no automation , where the driver performs all driving tasks ) through level 3 ( conditional automation , where the driver is ready to take control when notified by the system ) to level 5 ( full automation under all conditions ) .9 An analogy"}]}

For example , the output of a system might be framed as a decision that is implemented ( by humans or by the system itself ) or as a recommendation or input to a human-decision-maker , who may take other factors into account in making a decision .

Such an agent can be some lines of computer code , such as the automatic email replies that are sent out on behalf of employees on annual leave . Bots are used on social media platforms to generate social media content by automatically re-sharing content from other social media accounts . Some bots can be useful by automatically sharing certain information , such as statistics or scores from sporting matches . However , bots can also be used to spread disinformation , deceive or impersonate humans . In some jurisdictions , there are laws regulating social media bots \u2013 see , for example , the Bolstering Online Transparency ( BOT ) Act SB-1001 in California , USA.12 2.5 Rules as Code ( RaC ) Rules as Code ( RaC ) is a public sector innovation , which involves a preparation of a machine-consumable version of some legislation . The term \u2018 machine-consumable \u2019 implies that the rules are written in a way that they can be processed directly as rules by a computer . This can be done using a computer coding language or by using one of the platforms specifically built for this purpose . For example , Austlii \u2019 s expert system platform Datalex allows legislation to be re-written in a machine-consumable format so that it can be queried through a chatbot . RaC is not appropriate for all legislation and is most useful for rules that involve a calculation , prescribe certain kinds of processes ( such as a compliance process ) or involve simple \u2018 if-then \u2019 rules to determine matters such as eligibility for a benefit.13 As with other expert system techniques , machine-consumable rules can be written by lawyers or others without previous experience in computer coding .

Thus , while computer programs are examples of algorithms , a primary school child doing long division is also using an algorithm . Despite its broad meaning , the term in popular discourse has recently come to be identified almost exclusively with machine learning algorithms . 2.7 Machine Learning Machine learning is the most well-known sub-field of AI research . Machine learning involves a model whose parameters are set through an algorithmic process to reflect data or specific experience . Machine learning has been incorporated in systems and software to solve a range of problems too complex for expert systems or human decision-makers . The system is said to \u2018 learn \u2019 because its performance improves as it processes data or experience . Yet , machine learning is not the same as human learning . A child only needs to be shown a few pictures of a cat to understand what a \u2018 cat \u2019 is and identify other images that are cats . Computers can be trained to do the same classification exercise but will need a far larger training set . If the training set is too small and the number of features too large , then a model generated by a computer as to what a \u2018 cat \u2019 is may \u2018 overfit \u2019 the training data , rendering it too specific and therefore useless in classifying new data . When it is shown a cat of a different colour , for example , it may not recognise it as a cat because the system has already assumed that \u2018 cat \u2019 is associated with the colour of cats in its training set . Human learners and computer \u2018 learners \u2019 may thus be good at different tasks . 12 Bolstering Online Transparency ( BOT ) Act , 7.3.6 Cal BPC \u00a7\u00a7 17940-3 .

Suppose we had a set of electronic documents and wished to work out which were discoverable in the context of particular litigation . This can be done in several ways ( a more comprehensive description of actual practices can be found in section 3.1 Technology Assisted Review and Discovery ; this example is intended to be illustrative only ) : 1 Mode 1 , no automation : A human , usually a paralegal or junior lawyer , reads through the files and decide which documents are discoverable given a known set of parameters . 2 Mode 2 , automation without machine learning : A set of"}]}

Criteria , such as , for example , date range , list of words/phrases and file location for determining discoverability can then be decided . Rather than specifying which criteria are necessary for discoverability , however , a machine learning system can be used to deduce these based on patterns among these elements in the human-labelled training data . The process may be able to identify patterns beyond those that might have been chosen using Mode 2 . The trained model will use these patterns to categorise the remaining documents into those that are and are not likely to be discoverable . The process in Mode 3 is called supervised machine learning because the system relies on training data that has been labelled ( in this case , as discoverable or not discoverable ) . In unsupervised learning , patterns can be found in unlabelled data . For example , clusters of emails that use similar words and phrases could be identified . Such a system might identify that there are ( say ) three clusters of emails that tend to have similar language , length and format . The output itself will merely show that there are three clusters because the training data was not labelled ; the system will not be able to ascribe any meaning to the distinction between the clusters . A person may look at the clusters later and conclude that there is a group of emails about organising meetings , a group of emails about sales figures and a group of emails about sales strategies . Such techniques may be used in an exploratory way when seeking to identify documents relevant to litigation . In semi-supervised machine learning , only some of the training data is labelled . These methods are often used where labelling data is expensive and time-consuming but unlabelled data is easy to obtain . Varying the above email clustering example , one might label a small number of emails in the training set and use these to assign labels to emails that are , through analysing the labelled and unlabelled data together , in the same cluster . In reinforcement learning , the learning occurs through a reward function that provides feedback while a system interacts with its environment so that the system can improve its strategy over time . For example , a system may learn to prefer moves in a game of chess that have , in the past , ultimately led to a victory . Reinforcement learning is often used where"}]}

In continuous learning , the training and operational phases are thus not distinct . In Figure 3 Continuous learning , a machine learning model is initially trained using training data , perhaps from historic cases with a known outcome . After it is deployed in a real-world setting , the system is used on input data , yielding output data that has real world consequences , for example , making decisions that affect individuals . Data continues to be collected on what happens in those real cases and this information is used to further refine the machine learning model . In that way , the system will continue to learn while it is being used .

In machine learning , an algorithm is used to train the model . In the simple linear example , the system deduces the values of m and b that best fit the training data . Of course , the models used in machine learning are diverse and usually far more complex than a linear model . This section describes two examples of machine learning models .

However , there are circumstances in which machine learning can be used constructively to build a decision tree . For example , Ruger et al used a decision tree machine learning model to predict the outcome of US Supreme Court decisions , achieving greater accuracy than human experts.14 Neural networks are another , much-discussed , example of a machine learning model . The model is inspired by the operation of the human brain ( comprising neurons connected by synapses ) but the analogy is imperfect and modern neural network techniques operate quite differently to a human brain . As an example , neural networks can be used to translate handwriting into a text document by recognising each letter or number ( see Figure 4 Using a neural network to identify handwriting ) . The neural network will , using training data , make and weigh connections ( including factoring in offsets and activation thresholds ) from the handwriting ( the input layer ) in the hidden , intermediate levels that represent components of letters and numbers which , when taken together , represent a particular letter or number ( the output layer ) . 14 Theodore W. Ruger et al , \u2018 The Supreme Court Forecasting Project : Legal and Political Science Approaches to Predicting Supreme Court Decisionmaking \u2019 ( 2004 ) 104 ( 4 ) Columbia Law Review 1150 , 1195-1205 . | Figure 4 : Using a neural network to identify handwriting The basic unit in a neural network , called a \u2018 neuron \u2019 or \u2018 perceptron \u2019 , has inputs and outputs .

There are a range of different types of neural network , such as a feed forward neural network , a convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network . While these differ significantly , there are common features , including the fact that the model itself is typically difficult to explain ( in the sense of giving reasons comprehensible to a human as to why a particular output was generated ) .

Thus far , most of the examples discussed involve tasks such as classification ( e.g . a document is classified as discoverable or not discoverable , images are identified as cats or not cats ) or clustering ( e.g . emails are grouped into those with similar features ) . Generative AI is used to describe an AI system capable of generating \u2018 content \u2019 , such as text , images or music , in response to prompts.15 Examples include Google Translate , ChatGPT , Bard , and DALL-E . The most commonly discussed type of generative AI in the legal sphere are those generating text based on large language models ( LLMs ) . These perform tasks such as answering questions and writing text in formats traditionally used by humans such as essays and poems . Generally applicable LLMs , such as GPT-4 ( used in ChatGPT ) , can also be tuned to operate more effectively in specific contexts , such as law.16 There is a technique in using these tools well , with the ability to write high quality prompts ( associated with more useful outputs ) an increasingly marketable skill . Those interested in a more technical understanding of generative AI , and LLMs in particular , would need to look to : 1 Neural network machine learning . We have provided a high-level explanation at section 2.7 above . LLMs are trained on large volumes of text , for example taken from the Internet . Training a model may involve a combination of unsupervised , supervised , semi-supervised and reinforcement learning.17 2 Natural language processing . Natural language processing , often using machine learning , can recognise , process and analyse languages , and convert them into another form , such as audio to text . Briefly , \u2018 since language is contextual , statistics are used to work out the probability of words appearing near one another in a text \u2019 .18 These techniques are used inter alia for translation , chatbots , search , and text generation . 3 Transformers . This is a model architecture that relies on an \u2018 attention \u2019 mechanism , which are mathematical techniques to identify relationships between distant data elements ( such as words in text ) .

This involves a feedback process whereby systems provide feedback to each other . For example , one system generates a fake image of a person , whereas the other seeks to \u2018 detect \u2019 whether the face is real . By running both learning processes in parallel , performance improves . The ability to generate text , in particular , has led to questions about the usefulness of generative AI in producing legal texts ( submissions , judgments , contracts , advice etc ) as well as summaries and translations of such texts . Readers may wish to play around with generative AI tools to gain a sense of their capabilities . One can also find worked examples of what can be done in terms of , say , drafting documents in a ( hypothetical ) litigation online.20 15 Genevieve Bell et al , Generative AI : Language models and multimodal foundation models ( Rapid Response Information Report , 24 March 2023 ) 2 < - % 20Generative % 20AI.pdf > 16 See \u2018 Lexis +_ AI : Transform Your Legal Work \u2019 , LexisNexis < However , the tool is currently focused on the US market . 17 Bell et al ( n 15 ) 5 . 18 Michael Legg and Felicity Bell , Artificial Intelligence and the Legal Profession ( Hart Publishing , 2020 ) 35 . 19 Example from Ketan Doshi , \u2018 Transformers Explained Visually ( Part 1 ) : Overview of Functionality \u2019 , Towards Data Science ( online , 14 December 2020 ) < 95a6dd460452 > . 20 For an example in the context of litigation , see Kwan Yuen Iu and Vanessa Man-Yi Wong , \u2018 ChatGPT by OpenAI : The End of Litigation Lawyers ? \u2019 ( 2023 ) < although the tool it should be noted had access to the decided cases on which the facts were based . | Like other AI systems , generative AI systems based on LLMs have limitations . Some of these are discussed in the remainder of this section 2 .

If you ask ChatGPT to complete the sentence \u201c The cat sat on the \u2026 \u201d , it will output \u201c mat \u201d not because it has observed cats sitting on mats more frequently than on chairs , but because it recognises the pattern and the fact that a sentence beginning in that way ends in \u201c mat \u201d more often than not .

Those attributing sentience to tools such as ChatGPT fundamentally misunderstands its nature.21 There are also significant risks in relying on LLMs.22 2.9 Garbage In \u2013 Garbage Out The reliance on data in machine learning means that the accuracy and reliability of the outputs generated will depend on the integrity and appropriateness of the training data that is used . If , for example , data collection was patchy so that it was systemically skewed , then the system will learn the same skew . When Amazon built a recruitment machine learning system that was trained based on data about its existing , largely male , workforce , the system \u2018 learnt \u2019 to reject applications from women.23 Generative AI systems might similarly assume that a photo of \u201c engineer \u201d should be of a male given that the dataset from which a system is likely to be trained would reflect the currently male-dominated engineering field . This problem is often neatly summarised as \u2018 garbage in \u2013 garbage out \u2019 . Conversely , training LLMs on reliable sources ( such as textbooks ) will increase the reliability of the model.24 2.10 Bias The term \u2018 bias \u2019 is used in different ways within different disciplines . We look first at legal ideas about bias , then at technical bias . Lawyers \u2019 concerns about bias do not relate to purely technical concepts , but rather to an unfair treatment of the kind that discrimination laws have traditionally dealt with . Such an unfair treatment can arise through the application of machine learning , either due to the model itself or through the data that the model is trained on .

The top level in Figure 6 , \u2018 Model \u2019 , involves the AI system itself and whether it contains any inherent discriminating functionality . The middle level , \u2018 Data \u2019 , incorporates the bias which can arise when the data used to train the automated system is itself infused with human bias ( see section 3.4 Criminal Sentencing and Risk Assessment Tools ) . The lower level , \u2018 Concept \u2019 , relates to the underlying conceptual issues with the use of automated systems generally when determining the rights and interests of persons or parties to litigation . This foundational layer includes questions around the proper or fair way to make decisions about an individual based on aggregate or group data . Bias can also have a technical meaning that is conceptually distinct from ideas of fairness or discrimination . In machine learning , \u2018 inductive \u2019 bias ( bias that arises through generalising from a sub-set of data ) is inevitable . If we consider a set of data , there will be more than one rule that can explain that data . For example , the pattern 1 , 2 , 3 could be explained by counting , but it could also be explained by the rule \u2018 if the number is less than 10 , add 1 ; otherwise add 2 \u2019 . One needs to make assumptions ( for example , that the rule should be simple or that a relationship is linear ) , constituting inductive bias , to choose among the different things that might be learnt . When choosing machine learning models and algorithms , one is also choosing the nature of inductive bias and thus what kinds of errors are preferred . This is often done quite deliberately \u2013 for example , a government developing a machine learning system to classify threats to critical infrastructure may be more concerned about false negatives ( threats classified as low when they are actually high ) than false positives ( threats classified as high when they could have been ignored ) . When people with different disciplinary backgrounds discuss the term bias \u2013 for example , in the context of expert witness testimony \u2013 it is important to be clear on the sense in which the term is used . A data scientist may be talking about inductive bias whereas a lawyer may be concerned about fairness . The two concepts do intersect \u2013 for example , inductive bias that ignores \u2018 outliers \u2019 may have negative impacts on minority groups . However , bias is not a purely algorithmic phenomenon , and a machine learning system may be unfair not because of bias introduced through a choice of model but rather through bias in the training data . AI systems may also be used to expose human biases which might otherwise be undetectable or unprovable.26 2.11 Technological \u2018 Black Box \u2019 A technological \u2018 black box \u2019 refers to a situation"}]}

Even if humans can sometimes understand the inputs and outputs of a technological system , were they to view the inner workings of that system , they might find it incomprehensible . Accordingly , the person does not verify the integrity of the process used by the AI system to arrive at the output from the input . An explanation of connections in an artificial neural network is as unhelpful in understanding the system as is a neuron-by-neuron description of a human brain in understanding the reasons for a complex decision made by a human . This has led to interest in \u2018 explainable \u2019 AI . 26 See Sharad Goel , Justin M Rao and Ravi Shroff , \u2018 Personalized Risk Assessments in the Criminal Justice System \u2019 ( 2016 ) 106 ( 5 ) American Economic Review 119 . | 2.12 Explainable AI Explainable AI ( XAI ) is a sub-discipline within AI which seeks to \u2018 explain \u2019 AI and overcome the black box problem . Researchers in XAI focus on developing AI models that can be understood and interpreted by humans and on generating useable explanations of machine learning outputs . An example of an interpretable model is a decision tree \u2013 it is easy to understand how a decision tree operates to make decisions . \u2018 Explanation \u2019 refers to numerous ways of exchanging information about a phenomenon , in this case the functionality of a model or the rationale and criteria for a decision , to different stakeholders.27 An expert system can also generate explanations ; it is possible to observe this in action by playing with some of the application examples on AustLII \u2019 s Datalex system.28 The kind of explanation ought to vary depending on the context of use as well as the purpose of the explanation . For example , a consumer buying an automated vehicle will want to know about road testing and how different features work ; they are unlikely to be interested in a live explanation of why the car adjusted slightly to the left on the highway . On the other hand , a system used in administrative decision-making should meet similar reason-giving requirements to a human making an administrative decision.29 Similarly , a detailed explanation , constituting verification , will be required for a system determining the results of an election.30 Explanations may also be useful when humans are working alongside machines so that they can better predict the behaviour of those machines . In some circumstances , explanations are required by law , as in the case of the EU General Data Protection Regulation.31 The audiences of each of these explanations will also be different \u2013 with some having more technical understanding than others .

This section discusses examples to outline the main areas of implementation . 3.1 Technology Assisted Review and Discovery Technology Assisted Review ( TAR ) is \u201c [ a ] process for Prioritizing or Coding a Collection of Documents using a computerized system that harnesses human judgments of one or more Subject Matter Expert ( s ) on a smaller set of Documents and then extrapolates those judgments"}]}

The searching or gathering of documents will frequently utilise computers , but as explained briefly in the section above ( see section 2.7 Machine Learning ) , it did not traditionally involve AI . TAR becomes useful when the volume of ESI is very large , such as discovery involving thousands or even millions of documents . As the volume and size of litigation continues to increase , the use of TAR in the discovery process is likely to expand . TAR uses machine learning \u2019 s capacity to identify patterns in textual data . Different forms of TAR exist : simple passive learning , simple active learning , continuous active learning and other systems.33 Each of these are examples of supervised machine learning , as humans \u2013 preferably a lawyer familiar with the case \u2013 code documents and review ( correcting where necessary ) the AI system \u2019 s categorisations . Human review is needed to \u2018 teach \u2019 the software whether it has classified different documents correctly , and the method for teaching the software about which documents are relevant is referred to as a TAR \u2018 protocol \u2019 .34 Starting with simple passive learning , the program is provided with a set of documents referred to as a training set . A lawyer reviewer codes the documents in the training set , labelling them ( for example ) as responsive or non-responsive . Using this information , the program applies this to other documents . Using the training set the software creates a model or classifier which \u201c can then predict the classifications of other documents \u201d .35 Simple active learning is where the software chooses some or most of the documents for training . The lawyer still needs to code the documents , but the software can identify the documents that will be most useful to it in developing its model or classifier . The software identifies documents for coding based on uncertainty sampling , i.e . the documents it is most uncertain about in relation to relevance.36 The TAR process described above , where there is a training set followed by several rounds of sampling and corrections , may be contrasted with an alternative approach called continuous active learning , or what has been called TAR 2.0 . Here , the human review and the machine learning training process are combined ; review and training occur simultaneously . Due to greater computing power , the system continuously analyses the entire document collection and ranks the population based on relevance . Human coding decisions are submitted to the system ; the system re-ranks the documents , and then presents back to the human additional documents for review that it predicts as most"}]}

The system selects representative documents as the anchors for each cluster and then measures the distance of all other documents to the representative documents to group documents with a similar distance measure in similar clusters . Clustering involves no human intervention and is a form of unsupervised machine learning.38 Figure 7 : Example of clustering 8 4 0 -2 -4 -6 Cluster 1 Cluster 2 Cluster 3 -4 -2 2 6 10 The above descriptions are of generic approaches to the operation of TAR .

Master Matthews ( as he then was ) observed that algorithm- assisted document review was a useful tool in certain cases given the accuracy of predictive coding compared to manual review and keyword searches , the potential for greater consistency and cost-effectiveness , and the absence of restrictions in civil procedure rules.42 Citing similar reasons , the High Court of England and Wales allowed the use of predictive coding system in Brown v BCA Trading Ltd [ 2016 ] EWHC 1464 ( Ch ) , noting that the costs to use this tool was substantially less than that estimated for keyword searches.43 More recently , Deputy High Court Judge David Halpern QC allowed predictive coding to determine relevance in cases involving a large volume of documents.44 Ahead of the Rikki Neave trial at the Old Bailey , the criminal defence team used Luminance Discovery to analyse over 10,000 documents , saving \u00a350,000 and a month of time of manual review.45 In Da Silva Moore v Publicis Groupe 287 FRD 182 ( SDNY , 2012 ) , United States Magistrate Judge Peck observed that the Court was \u201c less interested in the science behind the \u2019 black box \u2019 of the vendor \u2019 s software than in whether it produced responsive documents with reasonably high recall and high precision \u201d .46 His Honour was acknowledging that the effectiveness of TAR could be assessed by reference to objective measures from the field of information retrieval , namely recall and precision .

Precision is important because it means that only relevant documents are subject to manual review at the end of the TAR process and therefore costs are minimised . Recall is also important because it demonstrates compliance with the orders for discovery to find and produce the relevant documents.47 As the total number of relevant documents in the database is unlikely to be known because of the high volume of documents , the recall of TAR can be compared with the recall achieved by a human reviewer coding a random sample of documents from the database . While discovery is primarily the responsibility of the parties and their lawyers , the judiciary needs a familiarity with TAR where disputes arise , such as whether to use keywords to identify relevant documents or TAR,48 in choosing between types of TAR and in addressing disagreements as to statistical parameters.49 Summary TAR uses machine learning to review and classify high volumes of electronic documents . Its main use is in litigation to undertake large scale discovery .

OADR may be privately run or state-sponsored , such as when it forms part of a consumer redress scheme . It may be synchronous ( the participants are all present at the same time ) or asynchronous ( the participants engage with the process at different times ) , or a combination at different steps in the process .

In the context of dispute resolution , human experts determine the questions that a citizen/client needs be asked to generate the information to determine how to proceed when faced with a particular legal problem . The aim is to structure the questions in a logical and user-friendly manner in order to identify the problem and then posit next steps . A successful expert system does not just accurately set out the necessary questions and information to provide , but also expresses it in an understandable manner for the non-lawyer user and provides a user-friendly interface . An ODR process typically has three steps:52 1 Problem identification and provision of information . 2 Facilitation of voluntary forms of dispute resolution such as negotiation between the parties and third- party facilitated ADR such as mediation .

Outcomes of litigation can be predicted through both expert systems and machine learning techniques , although the logic underlying the respective technology can be quite different . An expert system gives answers based on known rules ; for example , using legal rules to determine who is liable in a vehicle accident and what damages are payable.65 Machine learning relies on patterns in historic data . As mentioned in section 2.7 Machine Learning , a simple machine learning decision tree model could predict the outcome of US Supreme Court decisions.66 The data input into machine learning models like this could be comprised of many different features of a case . Features might be factors that would be known prior to the case being argued , such as whether a party is self-represented , whether a party is a corporation , the identity of the lawyers , the identity of the judge , and so on . Alternatively , the features could be information about the events which have given rise to the claim , such as the factual circumstances of the case . As it is time-consuming to identify and label features like this,67 there is interest in machine learning programs which can themselves identify relevant features from a corpus of documents , weight them , and use this information to make predictions about new cases.68 59 HM Courts & Tribunals Services , \u2018 Money Claim Online ( MCOL ) \u2013 User Guide for Claimants \u2019 ( 2022 ) < service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/503066/money-claim-online-user-guide.pdf > . \u2018 Practice Direction 7E \u2013 Money Claim Online \u2019 , Ministry of Justice ( Web Page , 10 August 2023 ) < procedure-rules/civil/rules/part07/pd_part07e > . 61 Letter from Lucy Frazer QC MP to Bob Neill MP , April 2018 < committees/Justice/correspondence/Lucy-Frazer-HMCTS-online-civil-claims-pilot.pdf > ( \u2018 Letter from Lucy Frazer \u2019 ) . 63 \u2018 Practice Direction 51R - Online Civil Money Claims Pilot \u2019 , Ministry of Justice ( Web Page , 10 August 2023 ) < gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/practice-direction-51r-online-court-pilot > ; \u2018 Make a Money Claim Online \u2019 , GOV.UK ( Web Page ) < \u2018 Fact sheet : Online Civil Money Claims \u2019 , HM Courts and Tribunals Services ( Web Page , 20 March 2023 ) < government/publications/hmcts-reform-civil-fact-sheets/fact-sheet-online-civil-money-claims # : ~ : text=achieved % 20a % 20 95 % 25 % 20user % 20satisfaction , days % 20to % 20reach % 20a % 20settlement > . 64 Letter from Lucy Frazer ( n 61 ) . 65 This seems to be the basis of the Singapore system .

Similar machine learning programs have been developed in respect of discrete legal issues such as the outcome of securities fraud class actions69 and intellectual property lawsuits.70 AI systems can , it seems , achieve very good accuracy . Sulea et al predicted case rulings at the French Supreme Court with an accuracy of 92 % .71 Katz et al , who targeted their analysis at predicting the outcome of US Supreme Court decisions , were able to predict specific judicial votes in 240,000 instances with a 71.9 % accuracy.72 However , these results are not always as useful as they may seem . In relation to the studies which focussed on the ECtHR , one flaw in the design was that the \u2018 facts \u2019 used in training the model were the judge \u2019 s summary of the facts in the judgments themselves.73 If facts are selected or presented in a manner that favours one outcome , the system might learn to associate such signalling with an outcome rather than the \u2018 raw facts \u2019 or facts presented by the parties . This is an inherent limitation in existing AI prediction methods ; they may succeed in predicting an outcome given certain defined variables , but they have not been demonstrated to be effective at predicting new cases.74 Further , accuracy ratings need to be assessed against a default of 50 % ( coin toss ) or higher ( if 80 % of matters on a particular topic are dismissed , then one can achieve 80 % accuracy by guessing that every matter will be dismissed ) . In this context , a 79 % accuracy rating ( as achieved by Aletras et al in relation to EctHR decisions ) may not be as successful as it seems . Pasquale and Cashwell also make the point that the study should not be used for purposes such as decision- making or even triage of matters because it necessarily takes irrelevant factors into account.75 Compared to legally relevant features such as case facts , it is technically more straightforward to extract information pertaining to characteristics such as the identity of the judge and lawyers involved in a case and use this to predict judicial outcomes .

Both chiefly utilise US data and apply to US courts . LexMachina works by obtaining court and patent office data every 24 hours which it codes using a proprietary NLP and ML engine called Lexpressions\u2122 . For every case , LexMachina extracts the patent involved , the players ( lawyers , judges , parties ) and legal data such as findings and outcomes , including any damages awarded . The variables that are extracted are analysed to look for \u2018 meaningful patterns \u2019 that provide insights into how a future case may resolve . The AI tool behind LexMachina has been applied to other litigation areas such as competition law , employment law and insurance . Ravel made a \u2018 Judge Analytics \u2019 tool available in 2015 . The tool claims to \u2018 surface \u2019 the most persuasive language to use depending on the judge and court . It combines NLP and ML , but also uses design principles to better communicate its insights . The underlying technology has also been used by LexisNexis to also provide insights as to opposing lawyers and expert witnesses.82 These tools purport to predict how judges will decide particular motions ( e.g . summary judgment , admission of evidence ) and even the outcome of entire cases , so as to assist lawyers to optimise the precedents they rely on and the arguments they make .

COMPAS was developed in 1998 , and can be used to predict , first , the likelihood that an accused fails to appear for trial ( the \u2018 Pretrial Release Risk \u2019 scale ) ; second , the likelihood that an offender commits subsequent offences ( the \u2018 General Recidivism \u2019 scale ) ; and third , the likelihood that an offender commits a violent act in the future ( the \u2018 Violent Recidivism \u2019 scale ) .88 The outcome of each assessment can be used by a court to determine , for example , whether the accused should be released on bail pending trial or be subject to a suspended sentence ( recognisance release order ) in lieu of a custodial sentence . COMPAS , and risk assessment tools like it , predict the future behaviour of individuals who are either accused of criminal wrongdoing or are incarcerated having been convicted of a crime . Factors that risk assessment tools might take into account include education and employment , family , socioeconomic and geographical background , and association with convicted criminals by way of family or broader networks . Supporters claim that COMPAS can determine whether an offender has a high likelihood of recidivism and that the program supports judicial decisions as to bail and sentencing on that basis . Many US jurisdictions allow , and some go so far as to require , judicial use of COMPAS or similar tools ; by 2018 , COMPAS had been used to assess over one million offenders.89 Indeed , the recently passed and incredulously named Formerly Incarcerated Reenter Society Transformed Safely Transitioning Every Person Act ( the \u2018 First Step Act \u2019 ) contains sections requiring the Attorney General to develop and release a risk and needs assessment system to determine the recidivism risk and violent or serious misconduct risk of each prisoner ( being minimum , low , medium or high ) .90 There are several well-publicised instances of COMPAS impact on an accused and their liberty .

However , on the basis of COMPAS , which designated Zilly \u2019 s likelihood of re-offending at \u2018 about as bad as it could be \u2019 , Judge Babler rejected the plea deal and sentenced Zilly to two years \u2019 imprisonment.91 84 For example , COMPAS has been used in at least the states of Florida , New York , Wisconsin and California .

The judge must consider defendant arguments countering the supposed risk he or she poses according to the COMPAS tool.94 However , defence counsel has no correlated right to challenge the accuracy or methods of the COMPAS program,95 and both the defendant and the judge may have limited information about the reliability of the tool.84 In dealing with the ground of appeal related to COMPAS \u2019 use of gender as a factor , the Supreme Court of Wisconsin held that \u2018 COMPAS \u2019 s use of gender promotes accuracy that ultimately inures to the benefit of the justice system including defendants \u2019 .96 Ultimately , the Court held that the tool could be used in proper circumstances , but can not be used to determine whether an offender is incarcerated or to determine the severity of the sentence , or as the determinative factor in deciding whether an offender ought be released on a supervision order into the community.97 In 2017 Loomis \u2019 petition to the US Supreme Court was denied.98 There has been some research in this space , both on the issue of predictive accuracy as well as on the issue of bias . The results in respect of the former are mixed . In various studies , predictive accuracy has been found : to have a similar reliability rate as individuals with no expertise given only two variables to consider ; to be less reliable at predicting violent crime compared to criminal behaviour more broadly ; and to have good predictive accuracy at the extreme ends ( those with the highest risk score reoffended at nearly four times the rate of those with the lowest risk score ) .99 Even where studies have been conducted , one needs to be careful in drawing conclusions \u2013 those studies all inevitably use a proxy for reoffending ( such as arrest ) that may not indicate actual reoffending . 92 State of Wisconsin v Loomis ( 2016 ) 881 N.W.2d 749 ( Ann Walsh Bradley J ) ( \u2018 Loomis \u2019 ) .

In a 2016 investigation , the nonprofit ProPublica looked at about ten thousand criminal defendants in Broward County , Florida , whose penalty consequent on the finding of criminal guilt had been , at least in part , informed by COMPAS . ProPublica \u2019 s analysis found that African American defendants were at an increased risk of receiving a false positive COMPAS score ( meaning that they were more likely to be flagged as high risk despite not in fact being high risk ) , whereas white defendants were more likely to receive a false negative COMPAS score ( meaning that they were more likely to be flagged as low risk despite not in fact being low risk ) .100 This was cited in Michigan v Canedo , although the use of COMPAS was not an issue fully raised by the defendant in that case.101 While the finding that the rates of false positives and false negatives are correlated to racial characteristics does not , necessarily , reflect an inherent bias in the program/algorithms itself , it instead is a reflection of the human bias inherent in the data from which the program was trained . Notably , COMPAS \u2019 developers claim that race , as such , is not a factor that the model takes into account . In other words , a defendant is unlikely to have to identify their race for the purpose of the COMPAS questionnaire . Instead , the answers to other questions may serve as proxies for race \u2013 for example , where an offender \u2019 s place of birth or residency contains a high proportion of people from a minority background who are over-policed and harshly sentenced due to human bias , the COMPAS system may indicate a higher risk score . If the program had , as training inputs and outputs , recognized a link between , say , the postcode a defendant lived in and the sentence they received , the program would also form that link as indicative of the process of reasoning it should undertake in calculating risk scores . The use of criminal sentencing and risk assessment tools extends beyond the United States and has generated mixed responses . For example : \u2022 Singapore \u2019 s Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon indicated in October 2022 that the likelihood of Singapore adopting AI tools for criminal sentencing in the near future was low.102 \u2022 The Office of Chief Registrar of the Federal Court of Malaysia announced plans for phased implementation of AI-guided sentencing guidelines in the sessions and magistrate courts.103 In February 2020 , the judiciary in Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysia was the first in the country to use AI in sentencing .

In Shanghai , Hainan and Guangzhou , the sentence recommendation system enables judges to examine historical cases with comparable factual patterns and presents the judge with a sentence recommendation.108 Leveraging big data and AI technologies , the sentence standardisation process seeks to ensure that key information is accurately extracted and considered.109 Where a judge deviates from the recommendation , they must provide written reasons.110 Another system , the Xiao Baogong Intelligent Sentencing Prediction System,111 allows judges and prosecutors in China to use big data analysis to extract information about defendants , charges , conviction conditions , aggravating and mitigating circumstances , and regions to recommend penalties in real time . The system provides judges with ten contextually relevant cases within the region for each prediction.112 While there has been less scrutiny and judicial consideration of these criminal sentencing and risk assessment tools , the concerns raised in respect of COMPAS are very likely to apply equally to any tool that seeks to predict and make recommendations to judges in the context of matters which do or may affect the liberty of individuals . Looking beyond concerns about the COMPAS system itself , the usefulness of AI in sentencing will depend on how sentencing decisions are to be made . For example , a majority decision of the Australian High Court has noted ( in the context of the use of guideline judgments for sentencing ) : The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.113 An AI system based purely on quantitative considerations would be similarly useless in a system based on individualized sentencing . The benefit of the Judicial Information Research System ( JIRS ) , the database of sentencing information maintained by the Judicial Commission of NSW,114 is that it combines statistics about sentences by reference to the relevant offences but also includes details about the nature of the offence and the defendant . In their submissions to the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee in October 2022 , Zalnieriute and Cutts called for a ban on the use of predictive algorithms in criminal sentencing , noting that such tools not only \u201c impose burdens upon people of colour without justification ; they also reinforce unjust views that are liable to result in the systemic denial of opportunities to people of colour across many aspects of public and private life \u201d .115 Summary Risk assessment tools which use data-driven inferencing have proliferated in the US criminal justice system .

Depending on the purpose of the system , and the safeguards thought necessary to be built into it , human oversight can range from human ( or technology ) -in-the-loop to full autonomy ( see section 2.3 Automation ) . As explained above in Prediction of Litigation Outcomes , the techniques which can be used to make predictions about the outcome of litigation could also be used for triage or even to automate decision-making \u2013 but this raises a number of issues about due process and the rule of law . In terms of practical impact , more work has been done on systems to support non-judicial decision-makers ( such as administrative officials ) . While still in their early stages , the below examples chart various attempts to automate not just the processes of the judiciary , but the decision-making of judges themselves . An Australian example of decision support is the Bail Assistant program being developed by the Judicial Commission of NSW which seeks to guide decision-makers through the complexities of the Bail Act 2013 ( NSW ) . There are plans to use the data from bail decisions to train a machine learning system which could then predict bail decisions.116 Another example in the judicial context is the EXPERTIUS system in Mexico,117 which advises \u2018 novice \u2019 judges and clerks as"}]}

In October 2022 , for instance , China \u2019 s Supreme People \u2019 s Court reported that 11,439,000 cases were filed electronically in 2021.139 Most standard e-filing systems use expert or rule-based systems ( see section 2.2 Expert Systems and Traditional Programming ) but AI may play a role in the future of e-filing .

By April 2019 , the UK Crown Court had reportedly saved over 100 million sheets of paper after moving to e-filing . Storing and locating documents is easier when they are in electronic format . Further , the capacity of parties , lawyers and judges to search lengthy documents for particular words or phrases has become near instantaneous through the use of searchable files , and the ability to navigate between relevant documents has been facilitated through the use of hyperlinked documents.140 E-filing may also decrease errors in the filed documents themselves and speed up court processes .

In Australia , the National Court Framework , adopted by the Australian Federal Court in 2014 , streamlined and synchronised the operation of State registries and the operation of individual judges \u2019 dockets . E-filing is now offered by most Australian courts . In counties of Florida , California and Texas , courts use a machine learning tool , Intellidact AI , developed by Computing System Innovations ( CSI ) , to filter e-filed documents . CSI claims that Intellidact is able to classify and extract data from documents automatically using continuous supervised machine learning ( see section 2.6 Machine Learning ) . In 2020 , the Florida county court reported that its goal was that at least 85 % of all e-filed documents would be produced by Intellidact . Intellidact uses machine learning to \u2018 read \u2019 filed documents , extract relevant information , use that information to fill out docket sheets to be put into the case management system , and finally make those documents publicly available . Where a document does not fit into a category in the training data , the system puts it into a separate folder for human review . Ordinarily , however , the system operates without any human oversight , and consequently e-filing is available continuously and not only when the court is open . This system , as well as a similar system used in initiating criminal proceedings in Okaloosa County , Florida , can also automatically redact private or sensitive information before publishing the filed documents . CSI \u2019 s CEO has said that Intellidact automatically processed 75\u201380 % of all documents filed without human intervention . Summary Automated e-filing systems may use rules-based systems or machine learning . The goal is to expedite filing as well as reduce or eliminate the use of paper documents . 3.7 Triaging and Allocation of Matters The use of e-filing has led naturally to virtual triaging and allocation processes . In many jurisdictions , triaging and allocations are done primarily or exclusively by court administrators or judges . Some systems keep \u2018 external \u2019 material , such as documents put onto a court file and orders made in a proceeding , separate from \u2018 internal \u2019 material , such as the mechanisms of the court in overseeing and determining a dispute . Other systems integrate all facets of a proceeding into a single online portal . For example , Israel \u2019 s Legal-Net , a \u201c cloud-based comprehensive court administrative platform \u201d ,143 centralises submissions of documents and motions , paying of court fees , planning of court calendars , official recording of witness details and appearances , facilitating the production of draft judgments , and tracking the progress of all matters before the courts.144 143 Amnon Reichman , Yair Sagy and Shlomi Balaban , \u2018 From a Panacea to a Panopticon : The Use and Misuse of Technology in the Regulation"}]}

The Victor Project , created for use in Brazilian courts in 2018 , seeks to reduce the substantial backlog being experienced by those courts.145 In 2017 alone , 80.1 million matters were awaiting judicial determination in Brazil , many of which have been described as \u201c routine and low value \u201d .146 The Federal Supreme Court of Brazil is using AI to increase the speed of case resolution , increase the precision and accuracy of matters , and facilitate appropriate allocation of human resources in the judicial system.147 It does so by breaking down and classifying cases of so-called \u2018 generation repercussion \u2019 , being those of economic , political , social or legal relevance , into classes of cases which may be decided together . The program has reportedly reduced 40 minutes of judicial work into a program which takes 5 seconds to run.148 The ATHOS system , used by the Superior Court of Justice in Brazil , is similar . This system focuses on \u2018 repetitive appeals \u2019 , identifying cases that can be treated collectively.149 Similarly , AI systems can be used to direct the attention of the court.150 Ryan Copus has shown how machine learning can be used to produce a \u2018 statistical precedent \u2019 , which asks \u201c how frequently has the court reversed cases like this one ? \u201d .151 Such systems could compare an individual outcome with general , or \u2018 standard \u2019 , jurisprudence , determine whether a case is \u2018 easy \u2019 and requires limited attention , or \u2018 hard \u2019 and so useful in developing the law . Statistical precedents could also flag decisions which depart widely from the norm , label certain unpublished opinions as \u2018 high-risk \u2019 , include cases relevant to an unstable statistical precedent in reporting publications , and assign more simple cases to lower-level court staff . Although this \u2018 statistical precedent \u2019 is purely theoretical , it is easy to see how such processes may be useful . For example , it could dispose with simple applications for leave to appeal a decision and instead an appellant could opt-in to the use of an AI system to determine whether there is a reasonably arguable case that the primary judge erred and so leave to appeal should be granted , such that if leave to appeal were denied the appellant would be faced with significantly decreased costs . Or it could help law reporters determine which cases ought to be published by determining which cases relate to areas of law with an \u2018 unstable \u2019 statistical precedent or vary widely from the statistical precedent .

The software reportedly improves transcription speed for law clerks from 120-150 words to 250-350 words per minute , reducing overall trial time by approximately 30 % .164 154 Ksenia Stepanova , \u2018 The technology that \u2019 s transforming court reporting \u2019 , Australian Lawyer ( online , 4 April 2023 ) < thelawyermag.com/au/news/general/the-technology-thats-transforming-court-reporting/441199 > . \u2018 What Is Speech Recognition ? \u2019 , IBM ( Web Page ) < 156 David Ward , \u2018 The Latest on Speech Recognition \u2019 , The Journal of Court Reporting ( online , 29 November 2016 ) < com/2016/11/29/the-latest-on-speech-recognition/ > , quoting former President of Voice Information Associates Walt Tetschner . \u2018 VIQ Solutions Commences Multi-Year Contract with Queensland Courts Department of Justice and Attorney General \u2019 ( Press Release , VIQ Solutions , 27 June 2022 ) < courts-djag-attorney-general/ > . 158 The Office of the Chief Justice , Digital Strategy for Courts and Tribunals ( Report , March 2023 ) 26 < assets/7-Publications/2-Reports/20230329-Digital-Strategy-Report.pdf > . 159 Damian Taylor and Natalie Osafo , \u2018 Artificial Intelligence in the Courtroom \u2019 , Law Gazette ( 9 April 2018 ) < co.uk/practice-points/artificial-intelligencein-the-courtroom-/5065545.article > . 160 Lin Haibin , Guodong Du and Meng Yu , \u2018 Big Data , AI and China \u2019 s Justice : Here \u2019 s What \u2019 s Happening \u2019 , China Justice Observer ( online , 1 December 2019 ) < chinajusticeobserver.com/a/big-data-ai-and-chinas-justice-heres-whats-happening > ; Mara Hvinstendahl , \u2018 How a Chinese AI Giant Made Chatting\u2014and Surveillance\u2014Easy \u2019 , WIRED ( online , 18 May 2020 ) < com/story/iflytek-china-ai-giant-voice-chatting-surveillance/ > . \u2018 \u5168\u7701128\u5bb6\u6cd5\u9662\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u8bed\u97f3\u5e94\u7528\u5168\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u8fbd\u5b81 \u201c \u667a\u6167\u6cd5\u9662 \u201d \u65b0\u9ad8\u5ea6 \u2019 [ 128 courts in the province have achieved full coverage of intelligent voice applications , creating a new level of \u2018 smart courts \u2019 in Liaoning ] Liaoning Smart Court ( Web Page , 20 January 2020 ) < 162 Liang Chenyu , \u2018 Shanghai Court Adopts New AI Assistant \u2019 , Sixth Tone ( online , 25 January 2019 ) < sixthtone.com/news/1003496 > . 163 Nyu Wang and Michael Yuan Tian , \u2018 \u2018 Intelligent"}]}

For instance , the Kerala High Court is experimenting with an AI-based tool to translate its judgments into Malayalam,166 while the Delhi High Court has used the SUVAS to publish Hindi versions of some judgments.167 Across the border , the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh introduced a translation software called \u2018 Amar Vasha \u2019 in February 2019 , which utilises AI to translate court orders and judgments from English to Bangla.168 In the Philippines , the Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo confirmed in April 2023 that the judiciary will integrate AI-enabled voice-to-text transcription services to make stenographic work more efficient and more effective . It forms a part of the Strategic Plan for Judicial Innovations 2022-2027 , a blueprint for judicial reform aimed at enhancing the productivity of the courts and freeing up court dockets . The tools will generate automated transcripts , which stenographers can then review , correct , and enhance , and these will be fed back into the software \u2019 s adaptive algorithms , allowing it to continuously improve.169 European countries continue to adopt innovative AI technologies to enhance their judiciaries . Italian courts use technology to create real-time transcripts , but with accountability for accuracy lying with users.170 State courts in Hungary use automatic speech recognition and transcription systems , which include abbreviations and references to legal rules.171 Estonia is developing an AI-enabled service that will transcribe court hearings and anonymise judgments.172 Currently , the Estonian government is testing an online writing tool , called Salme , to expedite the transcription process during court sessions that can accurately document conversations in the courtroom and attributing the statements to their respective speakers with 92 % accuracy rate.173 A text anonymisation initiative \u2013 called the MAPA Project \u2013 is seeking to introduce a deployable , open-source , multilingual anonymisation toolkit based on natural language processing tools . It is capable of detecting and anonymising personal data in different European languages to help support compliance with data protection regulations.174 It focuses on de-identification of information from texts , which can be used to anonymise training datasets , court rulings , and other matters required by law.175 Chatbot type tools can also be used to provide information to litigants , for example about legal rules"}]}

In January 2023 , a Colombian judge utilised ChatGPT to determine whether an autistic child \u2019 s insurance should cover the full costs of their medical treatment.179 While the judgment itself did not generate much controversy , the inclusion of the judge \u2019 s conversations with ChatGPT in the ruling sparked some debate . The judge had posed the following question : \u201c Is an autistic minor exonerated from paying fees for their therapies ? \u201d ChatGPT responded : \u201c Yes , this is correct . According to the regulations in Colombia , minors diagnosed with autism are exempt from paying fees for their therapies. \u201d 180 There have been a number of other examples of judges using ChatGPT in the judicial context , including in India in relation to a bail application,181 in Mexico in relation to electoral law,182 in Pakistan in relation to bail for a juvenile,183 and in Peru to calculate child support in a family law case.184 An English Court of Appeal judge also admitted to using ChatGPT to summarise an area of law.185 Although the Colombian judge advocated for the use of generative AI to enhance efficiency , he noted that this technology ought to assist rather than replace human judges . Others are more sceptical . Justice Melissa Perry of the Federal Court of Australia shared her experience with a generative AI tool in a speech at the Commonwealth Law Conference .

Although RaC is at a preliminary stage , the implications for courts and tribunals remain largely hypothetical but will be discussed in this section . One RaC project was the creation of a machine-consumable version of the Community Gaming Regulation 2020 ( NSW ) . The computer code for this project is stored on a website called GitHub , where it can be publicly accessed ( although this may not be easily interpretable by non-experts ) . Once rules are written in a machine- consumable format , the government or third parties can create applications that allow users to query the rules to understand how they apply to their own situation . For example , NSW Fair Trading has created such an application.197 Another NSW RaC initiative is the Energy Saving Certificate ( ESC ) calculator which helps NSW building owners to determine their eligibility to participate in the NSW Energy Savings Scheme ( ESS ) under the NABERS baseline method.198 Beyond government , AustLII has developed ElectKB which is essentially a machine-consumable version of section 44 of the Australian Constitution.199 The program is designed as a chatbot to assess whether an individual is eligible to stand as a member of Australia \u2019 s Federal Parliament.200 Other jurisdictions are also developing or have developed RaC projects . The French government initiated the OpenFisca project which focuses on the domain of tax and social benefits.201 The OpenFisca platform , also used in the NSW project on the Community Gaming Regulation 2020 , cultivates the development of projects that codify rules and perform simulations of future public policy changes . It operates through an open-source access format which allows the general public to contribute to the development of the code , thus fostering transparency and access to the law.202 Med Aides is a social benefit simulator built using the OpenFisca platform which aims to inform French citizens on their eligibility to national and local social benefits.203 Mon Entreprise is another RaC initiative built by the French government that offers a range of simulators designed to help business owners understand and comply with the rules associated with running a business in France.204 The New Zealand Better Rules Project has used RaC concepts in a variety of contexts to provide more efficient services .

There are longer-term implications of RaC for judges . For example , in future , a legislature may seek to give a machine-consumable version of legislation a formal status alongside the natural language ( e.g . English ) counterpart.207 The advantage would be a reduction in compliance risks for organisations seeking to follow the rule , as well as ( potentially ) higher rates of compliance.208 From a judicial perspective , this raises questions of what it might mean to \u2018 interpret \u2019 instructions written for a computer . The rules of statutory interpretation assume that what is being interpreted is natural language text addressed to people . There are no equivalent rules for judicial interpretation of computer code that causes a machine to perform a series of steps . The judiciary therefore will have an important future role in how machine-consumable versions of rules are recognised and interpreted in the context of disputes.209 206 Mohun and Roberts ( n 199 ) 44-47 . 207 Ibid 80 . 208 See Lyria Bennett Moses , Janina Boughey and Lisa Burton Crawford , \u2018 Laws for Machines and Machine-Made Laws \u2019 in Janina Boughey and Katie Miller ( eds ) , The Automated State : Implications"}]}

Clearly , these values are wide and subject to differing interpretations and emphases . Without wishing to engage in debate about the nature of core judicial values and what these may encompass , this guide focuses on open justice , accountability and independence , impartiality and equality before the law , procedural fairness , access to justice and efficiency . These values often overlap and interact with one another , and the context of AI tools is no exception . Yet , they are useful guiding points for understanding how AI technologies can impact the courts and tribunals . 4.1 Open Justice Open justice subjects court proceedings to public and professional scrutiny and is critical to public confidence in the judicial system.210 Many AI tools can enhance open justice beyond what would have been possible in a traditional courtroom . A basic , but nonetheless important , example is where an instant and automated transcription or translation service enables parties or members of the public who do not speak the language used in a courtroom to understand the proceeding by way of the translation . Some scholars claim that automated decision-making systems , if \u2018 correctly \u2019 designed , could reveal each step necessary to reach a judicial decision , providing more information about how a decision is reached than a traditional judgment.211 However , AI tools can also undermine open justice , enabled by public and professional scrutiny . Many of the technologies described in section 3 fail to provide detail as to their operation , either to the public , parties to litigation or even the judge presiding over a matter . Even e-filing raises this concern \u2013 an attempt to file a document may fail for reasons not related to published rules ( such as where a file is too large ) or for reasons that are obscure to both the litigant and the registry . While the implementation of modern technological tools in a judicial setting may seem justified in circumstances where the judge has the capacity to review or override automatically generated outcomes , that safeguard is substantially undermined where a judge can not view or understand the reasoning of an AI system . There are three significant obstacles to ensuring open justice with AI tools . First , those responsible for AI systems may decide not to share information about how they work , for reasons of operational secrecy , to protect commercial information or to protect the privacy of personal information in training data .

Ignorance of the process by which a legal decision has been made can be disempowering and make litigants vulnerable,220 and constitute a denial of natural justice.221 Third , open justice can be undermined , because some systems are so complex that a process-based explanation is unhelpful in understanding a system \u2019 s outputs . For example , an explanation of connections in an artificial neural network is as unhelpful in understanding the system as is a neuron-by-neuron description of a human brain in understanding the reasons for a complex ( or even simple ) decision made by a human . Even with the data science training to understand the process ( overcoming the second obstacle above ) , the human mind can not clearly \u2018 see \u2019 a complex neural network with a hundred thousand layers ( see section 2.12 Explainable AI ) . The only way to understand the system here is to treat it as a \u2018 black box \u2019 \u2013 to look at what goes in and what comes out and then to draw conclusions about its behaviour ( see section 2.11 Technological \u2018 Black Box \u2019 ) . For example , one could evaluate whether a system makes similar recommendations for men and women by inputting data on a random population sample comprising these genders . Similar challenges arise when reasons are given for administrative decisions that are automated , in particular where they rely on more complex machine learning algorithms . In 2004 , the Administrative Review Council \u2019 s report on Automated Assistance in Administrative Decision Making concluded that neural networks ( an example of machine learning ) were not generally suitable for administrative decision-making due to the fact that they \u201c do not easily provide reasons for their decisions \u201d .222 The black box challenge in generating reasons for administrative decisions was addressed more recently by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.223 They recognised ( 1 ) the importance of systems being understandable , so that agencies can demonstrate that decisions are legal and fair , and ( 2 ) the importance of statements of reasons , noting that in some cases the output of a system could be edited by human decision-makers to produce a more comprehensible explanation .

The first significant obstacle to judicial accountability posed by AI tools comes from the decision by suppliers to keep secret information about those tools , requirements imposed on others through contractual and equitable confidentiality requirements ( see discussion of COMPAS and other prediction tools in section 4.1 Open Justice ) . While the law manages general disputes relating to trade secrets in the face of litigants seeking information , courts should bear in mind the importance of judicial accountability when agreeing to purchase AI systems about which information is not publicly available or when agreeing to keep confidential information about the systems they use . However , the same concern arises in relation to , for example , documents discovered and classified by way of TAR ( see section 3.1 Technology Assisted Review and Discovery ) , which can form the foundation of a proceeding , and yet the judge or parties may have no real understanding of the method employed by a vendor \u2019 s software .

The issue will also affect appellate decisions where AI tools were used in reaching a first instance decision . The way in which any appeal would function is unclear . For example , would the human appeal judge reassess the same fact matrix in relation to the same regulation to be applied , or is the appeal limited to a question of whether the AI system itself is prone to error ?

This is particularly significant for judicial accountability for AI-assisted courts , which would undermine public confidence and trust in judicial systems.245 The proposed AI Act will also place AI tools used by the judiciary under control of many entities and this could impact on judicial independence as well as judicial accountability .

The advantages and disadvantages of such an approach will not be canvassed here,252 but it is useful to outline where things currently stand . There are also a series of policy reports addressing the question of legislation , regulation and ethical practice for AI , whether as technology-specific law , broader law reform , or proposed guidance , that could apply to public and private sectors.253 Even before any new laws or reforms , however , there are a number of laws that will be applicable to AI systems inter alia .

These projects are focussed on improving administrative decision-making and compliance tools , not judicial decision-making . Nevertheless , judges will need to consider questions such as the status of machine-consumable versions of legislation and the administrative law principles that apply to automated decisions . Judges will also play an important role in setting boundaries for automation in administrative contexts . For example , those involved in RaC projects recognise that discretionary decision-making power can not be exercised by machines and that replacing discretionary powers with strict rules may result in arbitrary , irrational or unfair outcomes in certain cases.255 However , there is potential that such known limitations may be ignored if governments seek to expand the use of automated decision-making in government , for example by replacing the exercise of a discretion with a prediction of how that discretion is likely to be exercised ( see section 3.3 Prediction of Litigation Outcomes ) . Developments in machine learning may provide further temptations to do this . Judges thus have a strong role to play in ensuring the accountability , not only of judicial decisions , but of the use of AI and automation in public decision-making more broadly .

Bias occurs not only in classification systems ( such as COMPAS which classifies people based on risk level ) but also in generative AI systems . For example , the system may make assumptions as to the gender of a person described in the input neutrally as \u201c judge \u201d based on an association drawn from the material on which it was trained . AI \u2018 detector \u2019 tools ( which seek to predict whether text was authored by AI ) are more likely to flag text written by those writing in a non-native language.257 More broadly , AI systems trained on data that comes primarily from US jurisdictions may have a bias towards answering questions based on patterns identified in US texts , using terms and concepts which may not be applicable to Australia . Humans are also prone to bias . Sometimes this is overt but , more often , it is unconscious.258 A collection of psychological studies suggest that humans , including decision-makers , rely on heuristics and cognitive short cuts , and are susceptible to effects such as decision fatigue.259 The question is thus not whether humans or AI systems are more or less impartial , but rather what systems need to be in place to ensure that decisions are not biased in unacceptable ways . For judges and juries , there are rules about evidence as well as appeal pathways . For machines , we should ask about what is being optimised and how these choices are made . Bias in human systems can be duplicated or enhanced in automated systems in different ways . We illustrate five of them in this guide . First , in situations where the training data is not representative or is generated through biased human action ( for example , arrest data where police target certain groups ) . This appears to be the most difficult example of bias to overcome in current machine learning methods \u2013 most obviously , ProPublica \u2019 s 2016 investigation indicated that African American defendants were more likely to receive a false positive COMPAS risk assessment score , whereas white defendants were more likely to receive a false negative COMPAS risk assessment score ( see section 3.4 Criminal Sentencing and Risk Assessment Tools ) .

One concern with continuous learning is the possibility of feedback loops , where decisions taken through the operation of the system influence how it is trained over time . For example , consider a system that estimates the risk of a convicted and incarcerated individual re-offending after their release . Assume it is used in making parole decisions . If one continuously trains the system based on the behaviour of individuals after they are released , this data will be impacted not only by the tendencies of those individuals but the decisions that have been made about them based on outputs of the system being continuously trained . An error resulting in certain groups receiving a higher risk score than their \u2018 true \u2019 risk score may lead to lengthier sentences for individuals in that group , which itself increases the likelihood of reoffending . The machine learning system will then \u2018 learn \u2019 from that instance of reoffending and may designate an even higher risk score to future offenders in that group . There are ways of mitigating against this , for example by using skewed sampling or synthetic data in continuous learning to reverse the impact of such feedback loops , but they are not always implemented . Fifth , a lack of interpretability creates a risk that more financially capable parties will be able to gain a greater level of understanding of technological systems , by hiring experts in the field , and consequently \u2018 game \u2019 the judicial process . This asymmetry would also undermine equality before the law.268 Principles of impartiality and equality before the law require not only that like cases are treated alike , but also that different cases are treated differently.269 AI systems , whether based on a pre-programmed logic or machine learning , draw on specific inputs . Rarely are systems designed with an \u2018 other \u2019 category that would allow for consideration of unanticipated factors . An expert system will only consider factors that were contemplated at the time it was programmed . Similarly , machine learning may cluster or classify together cases that ought to be treated differently simply because the type of fact that makes the cases different was not built into its model . In such situations , equality before the law can be denied because relevant distinctions are not drawn . 261 Ward ( n 156 ) . 262 Rebecca Crootof , \u2018 \u201c Cyborg Justice \u201d and the Risk of Technological\u2013Legal Lock-In \u2019 ( 2019 ) 119 ( 1 ) Columbia Law Review"}]}

For example , in cases of high commercial value , past patterns of conduct may shape the way in which a case is presented as lawyers \u2018 craft \u2019 arguments tailored to appeal to certain judges , producing an echo chamber in which each application of the data generates confirmatory data.270 As described in section 3.3 Prediction of Litigation Outcomes , evidence of supposed judicial bias on the basis of AI analysis of the outcome of proceedings has been an active area of research . However , as with any application of data analyses to individuals , there is the risk that individual differences or nuances of a case are overlooked in pursuit of machine-generated , and machine- recognisable , patterns . Statistical evidence which goes to the bias or partiality of particular judicial officers has not yet met the threshold for proving apparent or actual bias for the purpose of a recusal application . In Australia , statistical evidence has been rejected as lacking probative value , and held not to reach the high threshold of actual or apparent bias.271 However , such statistical analyses can indicate tendencies among judges to rule in particular ways , and presentation of such information may fuel public criticism of judges .

Deference to statistical figures , particularly when taken out of context , can be damaging when attacks on judicial impartiality corrode judicial independence .

If AI systems are used to determine the rights and interests of an individual , particularly in circumstances where that individual risks their liberty , we must not simply replicate human bias , but should design systems in ways that enhance our commitment to equality before the law . This should start with a requirement for open and accessible technologies to be used in courts , as opposed to those subject to confidentiality requirements . Further , AI tools can be used to detect instances of human bias which portend inequality before the law .

At one extreme , the idea of an AI system making judicial decisions based on fixed inputs would deny natural justice . On the other hand , many AI tools operate outside of the exercise of judicial power and therefore do not impact procedural fairness in the manner defined above . Where AI is used to generate evidence that can not be easily challenged ( as may occur for risk assessment tools ) or to prevent cases coming on for a hearing through automated triage , then procedural fairness is clearly implicated . In all of these examples , it is worth considering whether litigants are truly heard . This will depend on how AI systems are designed and deployed \u2013 do litigants shape the inputs to an extent that one can say that the system has truly factored in evidence presented and listened to parties \u2019 arguments ? Litigants , particularly in criminal contexts , should be placed in a position to challenge evidence against them .

Demonstrating , for example , that some piece of evidence is a fake or a forgery may become increasingly difficult as the technology develops . Litigants may thus require greater resources to challenge evidence . The outputs of risk assessment tools may be used directly ( as where the output is introduced into evidence in sentencing ) or indirectly ( as where an expert relies on the tool in producing his or her report ) . One of the claims made by Eric Loomis in his appeal ( see section 3.4 Criminal Sentencing and Risk Assessment Tools ) was that his right to due process was infringed due to the court \u2019 s reliance on a risk assessment which he was unable properly to challenge . The inability to question the risk assessment was because it was not possible to know how the COMPAS tool had \u2018 weighted \u2019 the different inputs . In that case , the Court rejected the due process argument . Though agreeing that the use of such a tool raised due process concerns , it held that cautious and selective use was acceptable . Finally , automated decision-making would also likely breach rights to procedural fairness , dependent on how it was to be used , whether parties consented to its use , or not , and what rights of appeal followed ( see section 3.5 Automated Decision-Support and Decision-Making ) . For example , extrapolating on the operation of the EXPERTIUS system in Mexico described above , if it involved an exercise of judicial power then allowing for the filing of evidence but not permitting argument or the challenging of the material relied on to determine the pension would be unacceptable in jurisdictions such as Australia . Consequently , at present , most AI systems do not seek to adjudicate the outcome of disputes . Procedural justice is also important in the context of appeals from decisions influenced by AI systems ( also discussed under section 4.3 Impartiality and Equality Before the Law ) . As highlighted through the discussion of the facts in Hemmett v Market Direct Group Pty Ltd [ No 2 ] [ 2018 ] WASC 310 , those in a position to overturn an automated decision need to understand the operation of the system concerned to assess its compliance with relevant requirements . According to the NSW Ombudsman , this requires maintenance of a register of all systems in use , with dated descriptions of version changes and cross-references to any changes in law or policy that necessitated those changes.281 Historic versions of systems should also be archived . 279 Al Rawi v Security Service [ 2011 ] UKSC 34 ; [ 2012 ] 1 AC 531 [ 13 ] . 280 Ibid [ 12 ] . 281 Ombudsman New South Wales , The New Machinery of Government"}]}

Access to justice refers to an ability to learn about legal issues and seek redress for legal problems . This may involve dispute resolution processes outside of court but also the right to approach a court . Susskind and other scholars argue that the legal profession should seek to automate more tasks , including through the use of AI , in order to drive down the costs of legal services thus making them more accessible.282 Self-represented litigants may be particularly interested in using AI tools and ODR systems to assist them in preparing documents and understanding and managing the steps involved in their dispute.283 While those questions are beyond the scope of this guide , access to justice considerations are also relevant to how courts engage with the opportunities presented by AI . ODR processes may facilitate access to justice by incorporating targeted information about the law relevant to a person \u2019 s dispute and then streamlining processes and allowing dispute resolution steps to be done remotely ( see section 3.2 Automated Online Dispute Resolution ) . For example , eBay \u2019 s Resolution Centre was set up to manage a high volume of low value disputes , where buyers and sellers might be located in different jurisdictions , in a largely automated way.284 Ease of access and efficiency means that parties to a dispute are more likely to make use of this ODR process . This is the case , too , with online courts for small claims matters such as that proposed in England and Wales and operating in British Columbia"}]}

Generally , only part of the court process is automated , such as the intake process where a person receives assistance to file their claim . Automation can also be used to increase access to justice through developing chatbots which can answer questions and direct users to better-tailored information . Some US courts are using chatbots to address commonly asked questions and therefore reduce calls to court personnel . For example , the Los Angeles Superior Court developed a chatbot for this purpose in June 2020 : To get the bot up and running quickly and efficiently , the court designed it along the same lines as the chatbot used to order Domino \u2019 s Pizza . The chatbot uses preliminary or guiding questions to lead users to the right answers from a knowledge base of 100 questions based on user guides and FAQs.285 282 See , eg , Richard Susskind and Daniel Susskind , The Future of the Professions : How Technology Will Transform the Work of Human Experts ( Oxford University Press , 2015 ) ; Richard Susskind , Transforming the Law : Essays on Technology , Justice and the Legal Marketplace ( Oxford University Press , 2000 ) . 283 See generally Amy J Schmitz and John Zeleznikow , \u2018 Intelligent Legal Tech to Empower Self-Represented Litigants \u2019 ( 2021 ) XXIII Columbia Science & Technology Law Review 142 . 284 Legg and Bell ( n 18 ) 140-143 . 285 Victor Li and Sean La Roque-Doherty , \u2018 Towards Smarter Courts : Artificial Intelligence Has Made Great Inroads , but Hasn \u2019 t yet Increased Access to Civil Justice \u2019 , ( 2021 ) 107 ( 2 ) ABA Journal 20 , 20 . | These types of question-and-answer system might then segue into the commencement of a claim \u2013 for example , the chatbot developed by Joshua Browder ( Do Not Pay ) , which generated a letter for the user to challenge their parking infringement.286 After an announcement in early 2023 that the chatbot will provide real-time instructions to a defendant in judicial proceedings , objections to the AI-assisted defence and threat of legal action led to the discontinuation of the experiment.287 However , \u2018 access to justice \u2019 is not only about \u2018 access \u2019 but also about \u2018 justice \u2019 .

If they simply become a first step , the workload of the court will not be altered , and in fact disputes may be made more complicated . If the decision of an automated system is appealed , the appellate decision-maker must review the information presented to them and make their own assessment of its veracity and weight in their consideration . Consequently , it is unclear whether the addition of this factor , perhaps difficult for the judge to understand , really makes for more efficient court proceedings . Care must be taken against attempts simply to improve efficiency in a strictly business sense , for instance by considering the judicial role as a typical \u2018 service \u2019 , and minimising the \u2018 cost \u2019 associated with putting out the same \u2018 volume \u2019 of decisions . There may be strong cost-saving reasons to make all hearings online or , perhaps , to limit all hearing lengths to five minutes . However , such attempts to maximise economy would undermine other judicial values such as that of judicial transparency and access to justice . 292 Michael Legg , \u2018 Reconciling"}]}

However , this level of accuracy is not always achieved . For example , unless there is a means of checking the validity of inputs , automated e-filing may ultimately create more work if errors that would have been identified by a registry clerk are missed . In the UK , the use of pre-approved divorce software generated an error , requiring 2,235 cases to be reopened and information to be resubmitted.300 Given the cost involved in creating AI tools to begin with , there ought to be sharply superior results for the attendant difficulties ( e.g . opacity , possible bias ) to be worthwhile .

How will changes in overall efficiency be measured ? 2 What harms will or might result from measures to improve efficiency , bearing in mind particularly the core judicial values discussed in this Part ? 4.7 Interaction between AI and Judicial Values This section explained how AI tools can impact on and interact with core judicial values . AI is an evolving field . Currently available tools are not sufficiently accurate , nuanced , and unbiased to replace judges or indeed many of the functions performed in court registries . In many contexts , there are no tools that would satisfy the standards required by the judicial values . However , AI systems can be , and are being , used appropriately by judges , court registries and parties . What is required is critical awareness of the circumstances in which AI is deployed . The questions posed throughout section 4 provide a useful place to start . While RaC is not a tool used directly in courts , it aims to enhance both transparency and efficiency in the administration of law by government . This may impact on how judges treat administrative decisions made by computer systems deploying code developed within RaC projects . The judicial values discussed in this chapter are not the only relevant consideration when determining whether a jurisdiction should implement a particular AI tool . The resolution of procedural issues or disputes over small claims may be less sensitive than criminal proceedings . Of course , judicial values remain important even in less critical contexts and even small claims can have a significant impact on the lives of vulnerable people.303 Nevertheless , the closer the proposed use is to the core of judicial decision-making , the more caution is required.304 300 Francesco Contini , \u2018 Artificial Intelligence and the Transformation of Humans , Law and Technology Interactions in Judicial Proceedings \u2019 ( 2020 ) 2 ( 1 ) Law , Technology and Humans 4 , 9-10 . 301 Reichman , Sagy and Balaban ( n 143 ) . 302 Ibid 635 . 303 Sourdin ( n 11 ) 235 . 304 Joe McIntyre and Anna Olijnyk , \u2018 Public Law Limits on Automated Courts \u2019 in Janina Boughey and Katie Miller ( eds ) , The Automated State : Implications , Challenges and Opportunities for Public Law ( The Federation Press , 2021 ) 89 . | 4.8 Court and Tribunal Responses to the Use of AI by Lawyers There has been some cases where the use of AI in courts and tribunals is litigated directly .

One example from New York was disciplinary proceedings concerning inappropriate reliance on ChatGPT.305 The lawyers concerned used ChatGPT as a legal research and brief drafting tool , apparently unaware of its tendency to \u2018 hallucinate \u2019 and make things up , including case law . They were representing a plaintiff , who alleged that he was injured when a metal serving cart struck his left knee during a flight from El Salvador to the John F. Kennedy Airport . The defendant sought to strike the claim out on the basis that the claim was statute-barred . The plaintiff \u2019 s lawyers asked ChatGPT to provide case law that would support opposing the dismissal . ChatGPT produced a number of cases which the lawyers included in their brief to the Court without reviewing the actual cases . None of the cases existed . When asked by the lawyer whether the cases were genuine , ChatGPT replied in the affirmative , and was even able to produce ( fake ) extracts from the cases.306 This makes sense in the context of predictive text \u2013 the fake cases and references were similar in format to genuine cases . But reliance on the outputs of generative AI as doctrinally meaningful statements ignores the limitations of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT . The lawyers and their law firm were subject to court-imposed sanctions of $ 5,000 , pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure r 11 or the court \u2019 s inherent authority , for submitting a brief with fake cases made up by ChatGPT and then standing by the research.307 United States District Judge Castel also required that the lawyers write to each judge falsely identified as the author of the fake cases attaching his Honour \u2019 s judgment and orders . His Honour stated that there \u201c is potential harm to the reputation of judges and courts whose names are falsely invoked as authors of the bogus opinions and to the reputation of a party attributed with fictional conduct \u201d . 308 Some jurisdictions have issued guidelines about the use of artificial intelligence in general and generative artificial intelligence in particular .

AI systems range from simple practices such as automated e-filing of documents to the complexity surrounding determining the likely risk that an offender will reoffend . The tension between the need for a judiciary to remain flexible as technology evolves and the normative principles of consistency and predictability in the resolution of justice is not a new phenomenon . In deciding whether any particular tool should be used in courts or tribunals , members of the judiciary or tribunal , as the persons overseeing the proper resolution of disputes , should be aware of the potential benefits which flow from the use of such technologies and their complex relationship with core judicial values . The use of AI systems in the courtroom has consequences for open justice , accountability , impartiality and equality before the law , procedural fairness , access to justice and efficiency . Many of the issues raised in this guide , such as use of proprietary software trained on data which itself exhibits bias , can be mitigated through better specification of requirements in procurement and design processes . That task will not always be easy as most of the judicial values discussed can not be converted into the kinds of precise , mathematical requirements that are easy to embed directly into technical systems.309 Ultimately , each AI system is different \u2013 so it is necessary to ask each time whether , in relation to a particular system , there are particular concerns which could jeopardise the open , accountable , impartial , fair and efficient delivery of justice . Kroll has suggested that technical experts be appointed as \u2018 special masters \u2019 in US courts to evaluate software-driven decision-making tools.310 He also discusses advantages and limitations of various testing methodologies.311 Understanding the common AI terms and tools , together with the key areas of AI use in courts globally , can assist in examining the"}]}

Continuous monitoring and regular evaluation will also assist in checking that behaviour corresponds to expectations in this regard . An alternative approach is to develop a set of rules or principles for the use of AI systems in courts . For example , in Brazil , in 2020 , the National Council of Justice ( CNJ ) published Resolution n 332/2020 on the use of ( AI ) by the Judiciary.312 The Resolution establishes ethical governance criteria to guide the development of AI systems , so that they are aligned with the protection and guarantee of fundamental rights , data protection and privacy . Similarly , in Europe , the European Ethical Charter on the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Judicial Systems and their Environment,313 sets out principles , such as compatibility with fundamental rights , that systems must satisfy . The document , prepared by the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice ( CEPEJ ) of the Council of Europe in 2018 , is non-binding and elaborates five core principles to guide both policy makers , legislators and legal professionals , among other stakeholders , working with judicial AI tools . In the European Union , several prominent legislative proposals have been tabled in recent years that will have direct impact on the use of AI by the judiciary .

REORIENTING BIG DATA LAW ENFORCEMENT CONCLUSION INTRODUCTION Behavioral ethics is an emerging field of scientific research that studies the cognitive aspects of ethical decision-making.1 Behavioral ethics 1 For a recent review of behavioral ethics literature , see Francesca Gino , Understanding Ordinary Unethical Behavior : Why People Who Value Morality Act Immorally , 3 CURR . OPINION BEHAV . SCI . 107 , 107\u20138 ( 2015 ) . Big Data & Bounded Ethicality 1/1/2019 research highlights the concept of bounded ethicality , referring to various biases that prevent people from making an objective and candid ethical deliberation.2 Since people tend to interpret reality in a self-serving way , they frequently are unable to fully recognize the harmfulness of their actions.3 Consequently , people do not generally think of themselves as bad people and do not think of their actions as morally corrupt , even when an objective evaluation would immediately reveal their conduct as immoral and harmful to others.4 Bounded ethicality is responsible for the persistent wrongdoing in all spheres of life . Behavioral ethics research shows that people value their own morality and will typically act unethically only if they can do so while still maintaining a positive self-image as moral individuals.5 Bounded ethicality means that people are often blind to their own misdeeds , and therefore find it easy to act unethically without experiencing guilt.6 In this way , bounded ethicality perpetuates widespread misconduct by a large proportion of people.7 This paper highlights the potential of big data analytics as a cure for transgressions that arise from people \u2019 s bounded ethicality . Of course , a total solution for the problem of bounded ethicality will probably never be available . Nonetheless , there is evidence that big data analytics has some promising features that make it especially suited to confronting the challenges highlighted in recent empirical works by behavioral ethics scholars . In exploring this possibility , this paper is the first to combine behavioral ethics research with the literature on big data law enforcement . The paper thus breaks new ground by connecting two important and trending fields of literature , and by offering novel possibilities for regulating and reducing the most common types of wrongdoing . 2 YUVAL FELDMAN , THE LAW OF GOOD PEOPLE : CHALLENGING STATES \u2019 ABILITY TO REGULATE HUMAN BEHAVIOR 1 ( 2018 ) ( \u201c various psychological and social mechanisms [ \u2026 ] prevent"}]}

Thus , it has been shown that bounded ethicality is central to all major societal ills , ranging from sexual harassment9 and racial discrimination of employees10 to political corruption11 and systematic violations of consumer rights.12 Since wrongdoing is so often caused by people \u2019 s bounded ethical capabilities , a key aim of regulatory intervention should be to improve individuals \u2019 moral deliberation.13 To illustrate this point , consider first the widespread phenomenon of sexual harassment . In the aftermath of the Me Too movement , it is now clearer than ever that sexual harassment is extremely common , often likened to an epidemic,14 with more than 80 percent of women in the United States reporting they have been the harassed.15 Research in behavioral ethics research shows that the bounded ethicality of harassers is a major cause of sexual harassment and its disturbing prevalence . Thus , harassers are too often able to convince themselves that they are not in fact harassing , but that their advances are welcomed,16 and that their behavior is 8 Id . at 88-104 ( presenting the need for a new regulatory approach , designed to enhance ethical decision-making ) . 9 Ann E.

This is the mechanism by which bounded ethicality perpetuates sexual harassment as a social reality.19 To fight sexual harassment effectively , policy makers must find ways to make it harder for perpetrators to excuse or dismiss it.20 Bounded ethicality is similarly central to misconduct in the commercial sphere , with misrepresentation by financial advisors being a prime example.21 Financial advisors provide unsuitable advice , misrepresent facts , and engage in unauthorized activity.22 Such behaviors are responsible for constant losses for investors , not to mention occasional calamities , such as the Enron scandal,23 or the 2008 financial collapse.24 In the United States , more than 650,000 financial advisors manage over $ 30 trillion in private assets for American families.25 The frequency of misconduct by those 17 Maria Rotundo , Dung H.

Big Data & Bounded Ethicality 1/1/2019 wrong benefited them personally , but was rather committed in the name of an organization.33 Finally , it has been shown that people find it much easier to excuse and justify a wrong against an unknown and unrecognized target,34 and financial advisors often work with clients they do not know , or have never met in person . The cumulative effect of these factors helps explain the ubiquity of unethicality in the financial sector . Thus , to battle misconduct in financial markets , regulators must account for bounded ethicality and find ways to remove or reduce ethical blind spots.35 Finally , consider the effects of bounded ethicality on the behavior of elected officials , purportedly required to consider the public interest above their own self-interest.36 A recent OECD report declared bounded ethicality as one of the major causes of political corruption , and suggested that behavioral ethics research should be used to battle corruption worldwide.37 Research indicates that bounded ethicality is a central cause of political corruption , as officials are often unable to adequately distinguish their own narrow interests from the best interests of their constituencies.38 Thus , for example , a politician will become convinced that he or she is voting for a certain bill because of the persuasive argument of a lobbyist , rather than the prospect of future financial support from the interest group represented by that same lobbyist . Public servants , like all people , are often guided by mixed motives , acting for both legitimate and illegitimate reasons .

More generally , our perception of regulation and law enforcement must change to accommodate behavioral ethics findings and the concept of bounded ethicality . Since people \u2019 s inability to conduct an objective and candid ethical evaluation is a major source of illegal and immoral behavior,41 one of the main aims of legal policy must be to improve ethical deliberation by potential wrongdoers.42 Regulators should therefore strive to engage directly with perpetrators \u2019 level of ethical awareness , and act to make it more difficult for people to dismiss or ignore the harmfulness of their actions.43 This means regulators should aspire to target perpetrators \u2019 awareness in real time , when wrongdoing is being committed.44 Thus , we propose the use of ethical nudges , regulatory tools that encourage ethical deliberation by guiding wrongdoers towards a better understanding of their own behaviors.45 For example , in the case of misrepresentation by financial advisors , electronic messages may alert representatives to reconsider their statements when they contain exaggerated content . As we describe herein,46 similar tools are already being implemented in some contexts.47 This proposed change in the perception of law enforcement , aimed at regulating bounded ethicality , calls for a shift in emphasis in current regulatory policies that are not structured explicitly with this goal in mind.48 40 Dolly Chugh , Max H.

Big Data & Bounded Ethicality 1/1/2019 This shift also presents several challenges , as new tools and abilities not traditionally considered part of the regulatory toolkit are required for regulating bounded ethicality . We discuss these challenges here and then proceed to highlight the solutions big data analytics offer . First , to curb bounded ethicality , regulators must be able to initiate interventions in real time , when perpetrators are making their ethical , or unethical , decisions.49 If misconduct originates with individuals \u2019 bounded ethicality , regulators must engage with people \u2019 s awareness to prompt improved ethical deliberation by perpetrators.50 To do that , regulators need to be able to predict unethicality in order to deploy ethical nudges at the time that ethical decisions are actually being made . Second , regulatory interventions must be targeted and specific rather than broad and general.51 Behavioral ethics research suggests that it would be nearly impossible to generate a general improvement in people \u2019 s ethical deliberation capabilities.52 Just as we can not expect to solve the problems of bounded rationality and make people generally more rational , we also can not expect to be able to solve the problems of bounded ethicality and simply produce generally more competent ethical thinkers . Instead , behavioral ethics research suggests we can improve ethical decision-making in specific instances by applying appropriate targeted interventions.53 This means that ethical nudges , designed to improve deliberation , must be presented only if and when they are truly needed . If everyone constantly encounters ethical nudges , such nudges would lose their meaning and impact . Typically , from an awareness perspective , ethical nudges must stand out to counter the phenomenon of ethical numbing , referring to individuals \u2019 decline in moral awareness in response to repetition and routine.54 Therefore ,"}]}

Each type of bias calls for a different regulatory response in order to improve ethical deliberation . To achieve this goal of improving ethical decision-making , regulators must be able to choose an ethical nudge that would help reduce the specific ethical bias that is causing unethical behavior in each specific case . Fourth , behavioral ethics research shows that , in some situations , a great majority of people will choose to lie and cheat.56 Consequently , regulators can no longer focus their attention exclusively on abnormal cases and extreme lawbreakers , but must be able to regulate a much larger percentage of people.57 Fifth , ethical nudges face a unique challenge , as they seek to prompt individuals to behave morally and consider the welfare of others . In contrast , traditional nudges help people act more effectively in their own favor.58 This motivational difference between traditional and ethical nudges means that individuals do not always have the incentive to be ethically nudged , and ethical nudges must be particularly effective in order to work.59 These challenges make it particularly difficult to mitigate the effects of bounded ethicality . We argue that the key features of big data analytics make it a particularly promising tool for overcoming these issues .

This capacity is crucial if regulators are to be able to deploy ethical nudges in real time , and thus influence perpetrators \u2019 ethical deliberation as decisions are being made.61 Second , by using big data analytics , regulators can minimize their use of ethical nudges , and deploy them only if and when they are needed . This will enable the use of targeted regulatory interventions , and help avoid the problem of ethical numbing and the danger that ethical nudges will lose their effectiveness if overused.62 Third , big data analysis can help ascertain in great detail the characteristics of each specific instance of wrongdoing . This can help identify the behavioral mechanism responsible for the unethical conduct , and allow regulators to apply the most suitable type of regulatory intervention in each case . Thus , regulation driven by big data analysis can the specific behavioral facilitate characteristics of each violation.63 regulation , sensitive tailored to Fourth , big data in law enforcement signifies a shift from data focused on repeat offenders and extreme cases to data that covers the population as a law whole , enforcement authorities.64 This comprehensive characteristic of big data is useful for the goal of curbing bounded ethicality , as wrongdoing is committed by a substantial proportion of people.65 those who have not previously encountered including Fifth , research shows that the use of big data analysis can help make existing regulatory means significantly more potent , as the abundance of information facilitates an accurate and effective intervention.66 This can provide ethical nudges the extra kick necessary to induce individuals"}]}

Part II highlights the relevance of behavioral ethics findings for law enforcement and regulation . Its aim is to demonstrate the need for a new regulatory approach that more explicitly targets the ethical awareness of potential perpetrators . This Part surveys prevailing theories of regulation and law enforcement and reveals their inadequacies in light of behavioral ethics findings . Mainly , existing regulatory paradigms that emphasize such concepts as deterrence and legitimacy fall short once we recognize the ability of perpetrators to ignore or justify their own unethical behavior . This Part details the challenges that behavioral ethics presents for law enforcement , and situates the problem of improving behavior in a world of ethically bounded actors . Part III continues by introducing the solution of data-driven regulation , and highlights its advantages in the context of each of the regulatory challenges presented in Part II . Part III surveys existing practices of data-driven law enforcement , and shows how these existing elements can be tweaked to regulate bounded ethicality in a more effective manner . Our proposal is based on combining the literature and practice of data-driven law enforcement with behavioral ethics research and its empirical findings . Part IV considers some of the main challenges for our proposal , especially in terms of privacy and constitutionality . We argue for a reorientation of current data-driven law enforcement practices . In particular , we show that regulation based on big data analysis should shift from its current focus on individualization and personalization , and adopt instead a situational focus . This will make big data law enforcement more effective in reducing bounded ethicality , and also more legitimate and less harmful"}]}

BEHAVIORAL ETHICS AND BOUNDED ETHICALITY Recently , there has been a dramatic increase in the study and conceptualization of non-deliberative decision-making . Extensive research has generated competing paradigms describing various aspects of behavior that are not regulated with full consciousness.68 The prominence of scholars far beyond the sphere of academia , such as Daniel Kahneman , who won the 68 Jonathan Haidt , The Emotional Dog and its Rational Tail : A Social Intuitionist Approach to Moral Judgment , 108 ( 4 ) PSYCHOL .

One paradigm that has been popularized by Kahneman \u2019 s book , Thinking , Fast and Slow , is the existence of two systems of reasoning.69 The dual-reasoning system , which has been the subject of thousands of papers70 and many books,71 differentiates between System 1 , an automatic , intuitive , and mostly unconscious process , and System 2 , a controlled and deliberative process.72 The recognition of the significant role of automaticity in decision-making has played an important role in the emergence of behavioral economics73 and subsequently behavioral law and economics.74 More recently , these insights have also been central to the development of the field of behavioral ethics75 and to its introduction into legal scholarship.76 A. Bounded Rationality versus Bounded Ethicality Both behavioral ethics and behavioral law and economics address the role of self-interest in decision-making . However , whereas behavioral ethics examines how people are driven by self-interest even when that compels them to act unethically , behavioral law and economics offers an explanation for why people do not make decisions that are in their best interests.77 69 DANIEL KAHNEMAN , THINKING , FAST AND SLOW ( 2011 ) . 70 Cass R.

As a result , people are not capable of making decisions to enhance their own welfare . In contrast , behavioral ethics proposes the concept of bounded ethicality , which focuses on people \u2019 s inability to recognize their own moral faults.78 Bounded ethicality clouds individuals \u2019 judgement and prevents them from seeing how their own self-interest is subconsciously driving their actions and leading them towards unethical decisions . To illustrate the difference between these two concepts , consider an interaction between a financial advisor and a client . According to the concept of bounded rationality , the client might have different biases that will prevent him or her from accurately assessing the value of the product offered . In effect , the clients \u2019 cognitive limitations hinder their ability to make decisions that would best serve their long-term self-interest . Conversely , bounded ethicality addresses the actions of the advisor and the mechanisms that limit the advisor \u2019 s ability to realize he or she is deceiving the client . Here , cognitive limitations sabotage the advisor \u2019 s ability to recognize that self-interest is preventing him or her from acting in an objective and professional way . Behavioral law and economics and behavioral ethics can thus be understood as studying opposing archetypes of cognitive limitations related to self-interest . Behavioral law and economics studies the ways in which our cognitive limitations hinder our ability to promote our own self-interest , while behavioral ethics is concerned with the power of self-interest to hinder our ability to engage in candid ethical deliberation .

The Cognitive Sources of Bounded Ethicality Behavioral ethics literature describes several mechanisms of bounded ethicality . First , bounded ethicality can lead individuals to ignore their own misconduct , or fail to recognize it as harmful . People 's ethical judgement can be bounded in the sense that biased thinking prevents them from noticing their own unethicality . For example , this can result from motivated reasoning , a process by which individuals ignore some facts and emphasize others in a way that helps them support a perception of a moral self.81 This concept highlights the various ways by which self-interest unconsciously shapes people 's understanding of reality , as individuals tend to interpret situations in ways that serve them best.82 Thus , through motivated reasoning , wrongdoers can interpret situations in a way that eliminates ethical dilemmas . Consequently , perpetrators often adopt a biased perception of reality their own wrongdoing.83 them from seeing that prevents Second , biased thinking can lead individuals to excuse and justify their own wrongs rather than ignore them . A central concept here is moral disengagement , or the habit of finding ways to excuse unethical conduct , even when the perpetrator is conscious of it.84 Behavioral ethics research describes a host of such tendencies , as bounded ethicality can lead perpetrators to justify misconduct through excuses such as \u201c he had it coming \u201d or \u201c it would have happened even if I hadn \u2019 t been there. \u201d Similarly , wrongdoers also engage in moral licensing , which relies on their positive self-image as ethical individuals to justify minor deviations from ethical conduct .

These psychological mechanisms not only amplify the effect of self-interest but also tend to limit people \u2019 s awareness of the role of self-interest in determining their behavior , thereby widening the gap between people \u2019 s actual behavior and their evaluation of its ethicality.89 Moore et al . demonstrate that people often truly believe their own biased judgements and thereby fail to recognize that their behavior is problematic.90 Gino and colleagues advance a similar view , showing that the level of control needed to behave ethically is much higher than that required to act unethically.91 Such mechanisms allow individuals who value themselves as moral people to routinely engage in immoral behavior that is not accompanied by malice.92 Importantly , individuals can not ignore or justify any and all wrongs . Therefore , they will act unethically , but only in ways for which they can find reasonable justifications.93 Many behavioral ethics findings suggest a strong link between ethical blind spots and automated cognitive processes.94 That is , bounded"}]}

First , consider findings regarding moral forgetting , reported in a three- stage experimental study by Lisa Shu , Francesca Gino , and Max Bazerman.105 At the first stage of this experiment , all participants were asked to memorize a university honor code , detailing , among other things , rules for appropriate behavior in taking a university exam.106 At the second stage , participants had to complete a series of short problem-solving tasks and report their results to an examiner in order to receive a monetary payment.107 Participants were paid according to the number of tasks they reported they had been able to perform . In reporting their results , participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups .

That is , they were less able to remember details of the honor code compared to participants who had not been given the opportunity to cheat.111 The findings of motivated forgetting suggest that people tend to forget facts that portray them in a negative light .

The first group of participants was asked to roll the die once , and report the result to receive payment . Participants in the second group were instructed to roll the die twice , but were asked to report only the first roll.118 Arguably , there should be no difference in the payments to participants in the two groups , because they are all are equally rewarded for the results of just one die roll . However , the main finding of this experiment was that participants in the second group , that was allowed to roll twice , found it easier to falsely report higher rolls and thereby receive higher payments.119 This finding demonstrates that the decision to cheat is not fully calculated or rational , but is determined by environmental factors.120 Fully rationale and deliberate cheaters would have cheated equally under both experimental treatments , 112 Emily E.

To illustrate this point , consider the case of simple employee theft.123 We all know that stealing is wrong . Yet , people find it surprisingly easy to justify stealing small items from work , even if they would never consider stealing cash worth the same amount . In this way , people \u2019 s bounded ethicality , or their inability to make an objective moral assessment of their actions , leads to a great deal of misconduct . In fact , studies indicate that nearly 50 percent of employees steal from their employer.124 Such misconduct is common , because employees are able to rationalize their wrongdoing as harmless or socially acceptable .

Self-perceived good people engage in motivated reasoning and often fail to recognize the unethicality of their own actions . Because they are blind , at least partially , to their own unethicality , they therefore have little reason to give appropriate consideration to the possibility that they will be sanctioned for their behavior.146 Thus , the role of the law as a deterrent mechanism is currently limited at best.147 Clearly , imposing harsh punishment does have value in that it can provide a clear message about the state \u2019 s approach and commitment to enforcing morality .

Behavioral ethicsoffers an alternative to the economic rational choice model of crime , which holds that a potential wrongdoer will choose to behave unethically if the gain from doing so outweighs the expected sanction.150 Conversely , under the behavioral ethics framework , an individual will behave unethically if it is possible to do so while continuing to believe that he or she is a moral person.151 Legal sanctions and deterrence policy must meet this challenge , and be designed bearing bounded ethicality in mind . From a practical perspective , this shift entails an immense challenge , as the purpose of laws and regulations applying this approach is to find potential perpetrators , rather than actual ones , and effectively engage with their state of awareness . 2 . Legitimacy Along with deterrence , legitimacy is offered as a principal rationale for compliance with the law . The rich scholarship on compliance and legitimacy posits that people obey the law because they perceive it as legitimate.152 The main indicator for legitimacy is usually described as procedural fairness ; that is , individuals tend to obey the law if they think it is the product of a just process of legal deliberation and rule-making.153 Thus , when laws appear fair and legitimate , there is evidence that they shift behavior towards greater compliance and acceptance of organizational rules seem to be more sensitive to the probability of detection than to the severity of punishment ; similarly , the expressive effects of punishment seems to be more important than the punishment itself ) . 149 This is not to say that deterrence doesn \u2019 t work in curbing unethically .

In short , there are no practical regulatory tools for ensuring that people are aware of the law and its fairness when they decide whether or not to behave unethically . While deterrence and legitimacy are perceived as fostering compliance in different ways , the effectiveness of both is still predicated on the assumption that people make deliberate decisions regarding the law . Thus , much of the current literature on legal compliance examines people \u2019 s decision-making in the context of ethical dilemmas , ignoring the possibility that people might engage in motivated reasoning and self-deception . The rich experimental literature on compliance assumes that people recognize a moral conflict and then proceed to shape their actions accordingly . This approach fails to address the fact that people may ignore the conflict to begin with , or simply reason it away . The assumption underlying compliance theory is that people evaluate the fairness , procedural or other , of the law and then make a conscious decision as to whether or not to comply . For example , Fishbacher et al . have measured levels of compliance by asking people to make a choice to either comply or behave unethically , clearly defining the choice between doing \u201c good \u201d or \u201c bad. \u201d 157 This framing explicitly ignores the possibility that people 's bounded ethicality will undermine their ability to recognize their choice as being the \u201c bad \u201d one . Behavioral ethics research shows that , in reality , motivated reasoning often leads individuals to think that the choice that serves them best is also ethically permissible.158 Again , these insights call for a change in emphasis in law enforcement . Instead of trying to make sure that laws appear procedurally legitimate , policy makers should focus their efforts on improving the ability of potential perpetrators to appreciate that they are indeed in violation of these 154 Yuval Feldman & Tom R.

Of course , once this understanding is achieved , perceptions of legitimacy might prove to be important in ensuring compliance . Yet , for people who are not engaging in ethical deliberations and are not made more fully aware of the unethicality of their actions , legitimacy on its own can not achieve compliance . 3 . Ethical Nudges The analysis of deterrence and legitimacy offered above highlights the flawed assumptions that underlie our legal system and the resulting failure of existing regulatory approaches to provide an adequate response to most instances of wrongdoing .

The key challenge addressed by this Article is how to create a regulatory policy to deal with misconduct perpetrated with varying levels of awareness and motivation . To ensure compliance with the law , it is not enough to threaten individuals with sanctions , nor it is sufficient to ensure that laws are perceived as fair . The key to regulating misconduct is to find ways of enabling perpetrators to evaluate their actions more candidly,160 taking into consideration the possible legal ramifications of those actions and the procedural fairness of legal rules . In this sense , the concepts of deterrence and legitimacy must be reexamined and redefined , as they are being incorporated into a new behavioral framework that focuses on decision-making . In regulating conduct , therefore , it is not sufficient to increase the effectiveness of underlying incentive structures , since perpetrators are not necessarily aware of them . Rather , it is more important to improve deliberation and ethical engagement by enhancing people \u2019 s ability to evaluate the relevance of the existing legal incentive structure"}]}

First , to improve behavior , regulators can directly target the awareness of perpetrators , thereby eliciting more candid ethical deliberation . This can be achieved using ethical alerts , and a variety of other de-biasing mechanisms . Such if designed appropriately , can address the problem of bounded ethicality by encouraging perpetrators to use System 2 thinking and override self-serving biases.163 These techniques can prompt potential wrongdoers to consider the effects of their actions , to view the situations from the perspective of potential victims , or to report their decisions to an objective third party . The choice of regulatory tool depends on the particular bias hindering ethical deliberation . Consequently , if a perpetrator engages in motivated reasoning and interprets a situation in a way that makes it difficult to see the wrongfulness of the contemplated actions , it may be necessary to alert that individual to the true nature of the situation . Alternatively , if a perpetrator is morally disengaged , in that he or she is aware of the facts of the situation , but finds ways to justify the misconduct , an ethical nudge emphasizing the victims of such misconduct or reminding the potential perpetrator of possible legal sanctions may be effective in preventing misconduct . Another form of ethical nudge is the use of situational design , aimed at improving ethical deliberation indirectly , by eliminating ethical blind spots and situations that lead to unethicality . Bounded ethicality is strongest in situations in which people find it easy to ignore their own wrongdoing.164 Regulators \u2019 ability to prevent such situations can prove crucial in reducing misconduct . That is , instead of engaging with perpetrators \u2019 awareness directly through the use of ethical alerts , regulators may instead redesign problematic situations to ensure that ethical blind spots are not created in the first place . To illustrate this alternative approach , consider again the widespread problem of sexual harassment in the workplace . Research on sexual harassment indicates specific circumstances under which sexual harassment is more common,165 such as in male-dominated environments or under male 162 Shu , Gino & Bazerman , supra note 53 , at 344 . 163 Christine Jolls and Cass R.

One obvious way to address this problem would be to provide sexual harassment training , which would directly increase the level of awareness of potential perpetrators . Another course of action would be to reshape the situation , thereby eliminating the circumstances in which perpetrators find it easier to ignore or excuse their own unethicality . This can be achieved , for example , by ensuring equal representation for women in the workplace or in executive positions.167 Note that ethical nudges are related to , yet distinct from , traditional nudges , as popularized by Sunstein and Thaler . Traditional nudges are policy interventions designed to change behavior without creating economic incentives or limiting people 's freedom of action by eliminating other possibilities . They aim at improving people \u2019 s ability to make informed and rational choices that will maximize their own well-being.168 In contrast , ethical nudges are designed to encourage more ethical conduct and to reduce the harm imposed on others .

Real Time Responses Behavioral ethics research shows that misconduct originates with the bounded ethicality of individuals,169 that is , with their biased thinking and limited ability to conduct a full and candid moral deliberation at the time they take action.170 This means that the first challenge for law enforcement is to induce awareness in real time . In order to influence behavior and actually reduce misconduct , regulators and law enforcers must find ways to effectively engage with people \u2019 s ethical deliberation and with their real-time decision- making process.171 This need to implant the law into people \u2019 s consciousness more effectively is a considerable practical challenge . It also represents a significant addition to the current understanding of law enforcement and compliance , which does not explicitly consider bounded ethicality and the need to engage with the moral awareness of potential perpetrators . For example , when considering deterrence , law enforcement efforts should focus not on punishing the guilty ex post facto but on ensuring that the possibility of punishment effectively triggers candid moral deliberation in real time , when potential perpetrators are considering , or failing to consider , the potential harmfulness of their own actions . 2 . Ethical Numbing Behavioral ethics research suggests that bounded ethicality is in many ways an unavoidable component of the human psyche.172 People are ethically bound due to a long list of cognitive limitations and those cognitive limitations , together with the consequences of bounded ethicality , are here to stay . Just as it is unlikely that we will be able to remedy bounded rationality and make people generally more rational , it is similarly unlikely that we will find general solutions to the problems of bounded ethicality and will be able to make people generally more ethical . There are many ways in which the motivating force behind people \u2019 s ethical biases has many positive attributes , as its aim is to enhance people \u2019 s self-perceptions.173 What behavioral ethics suggests that what is possible is to help individuals make better and more acceptable moral judgements in specific instances by triggering more candid moral deliberation in opportune times.174 This 169 FELDMAN , supra note 2 , at 1 . 170 Id . at 152 . 171 Id . at 88 . 172 Chugh & Kern , supra note 52 , at 85 . 173 Greenwald & Banaji , supra note 4 , at 10\u201311 . 174 Shu , Gino & Bazerman , supra note 53 ,"}]}

Big Data & Bounded Ethicality 1/1/2019 necessitates a targeted regulatory approach , whereby policy makers know when to activate regulatory interventions . To improve ethical deliberation , regulatory intervention must be thoughtful and targeted , so as to avoid the dangers of ethical numbing.175 To improve deliberation by wrongdoers , policy makers must be able to deploy nudges in appropriate moments . If ethical nudges are untargeted and used constantly , they will lose all effectiveness . Ethical alerts are more effective if they disturb rather than become part of routines . Only if ethical nudges disturb the routine can they prompt individuals to make more candid ethical deliberations . In essence , to avoid moral numbing , ethical alerts must stand out . For all these reasons , the practical challenge for any regulatory scheme that attempts to improve ethical deliberation is to be narrow and targeted , rather than general and broad . 3 . Selecting Among Nudge Types To effectively regulate unethical conduct , policy makers must be able to match appropriate regulatory responses to different cases . Behavioral ethics research shows that unethical behavior originates with many distinct types of ethical biases . Ethical nudges , those regulatory interventions designed to improve deliberation , will only be effective if they are responsive to the specific causes of bounded ethicality in each specific case . To select the most effective intervention , regulators will need to know which cognitive mechanisms are responsible for generating misconduct in specific cases . For instance , assume a wrongdoer behaves unethically because he or she is able to convince himself or herself that the particular behavior harms no one . If this is the case , the most direct way to improve deliberation would be to alert the perpetrator to more candidly consider the possible harm caused to others . Alternatively , assume a wrongdoer commits an offense because the legal standard is ambiguous , making it easier for perpetrators to convince themselves that their behavior is permitted . In such a case , the simplest , most effective intervention is to clarify the legal rule or to nudge the perpetrator to make a more candid deliberation of its meaning . The following paragraphs offer a menu of such ethical nudges , and highlight the importance of the ability to make an informed choice among them . Behavioral ethics research shows that motivated reasoning causes perpetrators to ignore or disregard crucial facts , thus enabling them to avoid ethical conflicts instead of facing them.176 To overcome this mechanism , regulators could use ethical alerts to remind potential perpetrators of facts 175 Tenbrunsel & Messick , supra note 54 , at 228 . 176 Kunda , supra note 81 , at 480 . 1/1/2019 Feldman & Kaplan they might otherwise ignore , or to prompt perpetrators to engage in more fitting ethical deliberations . Ethical alerts are simple cues that can be used to trigger moral deliberation . Placing"}]}

Thus , upon placing a request for office supplies on a company 's computerized system , an employee may be reminded that companies regularly go bankrupt due to employee theft . Such measures can be highly effective . For example , in a recent meta-analysis , Kobis and colleagues show that intuitive dishonesty disappears if perpetrators are reminded of potential injuries to victims.177 That is , when making ethical choices , intuitive thinking leads people to reach self-serving decisions , but only when no specific individual is assumed to get hurt.178 Prompting perpetrators to consider the case of a specific potential victim can improve conduct even if decision-making remains intuitive rather than deliberate.179 Similarly , employees may be reminded that stealing is wrong , that office supplies cost money , that consumer goods cost 10 to 15 percent more due to employee theft , that employee theft is a major societal issue , costing ten times more than domestic break-ins , and that it is a crime and punishable by severe fines . Behavioral ethics research has shown that such reminders can significantly improve behavior in varied contexts.180 Alerting potential perpetrators to such facts can trigger ethical deliberation and make it more difficult for them to dismiss employee theft as ethically weightless . Thus , in some cases , just reminding perpetrators of possible legal sanctions may be the most effective route , while in other cases it may be more productive to remind them of the injuries their actions can cause others . Note that such reminders may also refer to the potential penalty for violation of duty or a breach of the obligation to signal the true value of a good .

Studies have shown that individuals are less likely to act badly after reading morally laden texts , even short ones . Such measures are designed to prompt potential wrongdoers to consider the effects of their actions , to view situations from the perspective of potential victims , or to report their decisions to an objective third party . De-biasing tools employ a variety of cognitive-based techniques to overcome biased thinking and non- deliberative choices and make it possible for people to engage more fully in moral deliberation.183 These goals can be achieved through mechanisms that encourage reflection and self-awareness . Reflection can be achieved directly , by forcing individuals to take a few extra moments to consider the implications of their actions . This can be especially useful in curbing routine unethicality and discouraging work-related misconduct . For example , upon making sales of certain types , financial advisors may be prompted to take a moment to consider the deal they are offering . JPMorgan Chase routinely sends electronic warnings to its traders reminding them to make sure they are remaining within the boundaries of the personal trading rules.184 These measures alert employees to engage in System 2 thinking before completing the task at hand.185 Similarly , tailored generated alerts might occasionally require the sales representatives to record face-to-face meetings or phone calls . Alternatively , sales representatives could be required to produce written protocols , report their actions to a colleague or a supervisor , or to share more information with their clients . Such prompts can serve as a disruption of the professionals \u2019 routines , encouraging them to use their System 2 thinking and gain a different perspective on their situations . to curb misconduct by sales representatives , Accountability mechanisms are also a highly useful form of de-biasing , whereby individuals are asked to explain the reasoning for their decisions 182 Shahar Ayal , Francesca Gino , Rachel Barkan & Dan Ariely , Three Principles to REVISE People \u2019 s Unethical Behavior , 10 ( 6 ) PERSP .

First , merely articulating a justification can prompt System 2 thinking , which , by itself , can sometimes overcome ethical biases . Second , people 's awareness of the possibility that their written reports may be read by somebody else can also trigger caution and deliberation . Importantly , the benefit of accountability reports is manifest even in those cases when they are not actually read . The very requirement of writing them suffices to reduce wrongdoing , as it makes it significantly more difficult for perpetrators to ignore or excuse their own actions . Accountability mechanisms may prove especially useful when wrongdoers operate under a veil of anonymity , are confident that their wrongdoing will not be discovered , or do not know the potential victims of their actions . Behavioral ethics research indicates that misconduct is especially common when there is no single identified victim , but rather many unidentified ones.187 This is because moral deliberation is often triggered by personal interaction . Accountability mechanisms can substitute for such interaction when it is otherwise missing . Declarations of various types also offer opportunities to mitigate the effects of bounded ethicality.188 Declarations include any measure prompting individuals to state their commitment to a code of conduct , to ethical behavior generally , or to adherence to a legal standard . Such speech acts have been shown to trigger moral deliberation in many situations . A simple example of the use of declarations is found in the context of corporate governance or fiduciary duties . For example , before important votes are made , directors and executives could be required to sign declarations stating they are aware of the legal standards under which they operate , that they know what types of conflicts of interest they are obligated to disclose and that such conflicts are not present.189 Such declarations serve a dual purpose . First , according to behavioral ethics research , actively declaring adherence to the legal standard in writing can reduce unethical behavior .

Requiring a declaration changes the status of the unethical conduct , making it much less likely that executives will fail to announce a conflict of interest . Second , from a legal perspective , signing a declaration reminds people that they can be prosecuted for perjury . Reminders of legal consequences have been shown to be effective in preventing even subtle conflict of interests.192 The different types of ethical nudges can all improve ethical deliberation in relevant cases . Behavioral ethics research offers a large assortment of regulatory tools that might be helpful in reducing misconduct in different situations . The crucial point is that , to effectively combat unethicality , regulators must be able to make informed choices and match the appropriate regulatory responses to different situations and types of misconduct . 4 . The Scope of Regulation Behavioral ethics research shows that unethical behavior is not confined to any specific segment of the population comprised of particularly malevolent individuals.193 Rather , unethical behavior is nearly universal and is commonly practiced by the majority of ordinary people.194 Thus , lab experiments show that bounded ethicality makes unethical conduct nearly universal under certain circumstances . 195 In a recent meta-analysis of studies involving more than 30,000 participants , researchers found that people choose to lie and cheat in about 50 percent of all experimental observations.196 These facts present an immense challenge from a law enforcement perspective . To curb unethicality , it is not enough to identify and punish extreme divergences from prevalent moral and legal norms . Instead , regulators should adopt a broader perspective and more seriously consider the structural sources of systematic and persistence wrongdoing by \u201c ordinary \u201d people . 5 . Willingness to be Nudged Another challenge in regulating bounded ethicality relates to people \u2019 s incentives and willingness to be nudged . Ethical nudges are different from 191 Mark Spranca , Elisa Minsk & Jonathan Baron , Omission and Commission in Judgment and Choice , 27 ( 1 ) J . EXPERIMENTAL SOC .

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ethical nudges aim to help people engage in more candid moral deliberation , and consider the interests of others.198 Therefore , if ethical nudges are to succeed in combating bounded ethicality and improving ethical decision-making , they must be more forceful and more difficult to ignore or downplay than traditional nudges . Ethical nudges work in opposition to people \u2019 s natural incentive system , and not in support of it , and therefore require additional support in order to be effective . Therefore , a \u201c naked \u201d ethical nudge will not always be potent enough to cause people to be aware of the ethical implications of their behavior , and such nudges may need to be reinforced or accompanied by an external legal threat . For that reason , legal sanctions designed in accordance with nudge approach insights could prove most effective . Such instruments , while reminding people of their unethical tendencies , will also draw their attention to the potential legal consequences of their unethical behavior . When functioning as nudges , the legal instruments should be designed to focus less on changing people \u2019 s cost-benefit calculation and more on increasing their awareness of the full implications , including legal ones , of their wrongdoing . Therefore , in addition to the soft regulatory measures mentioned above , bounded ethicality can be regulated through more traditional means , if those are adjusted appropriately . That is , in some cases , the most effective way to improve ethical deliberation is by increasing sanctions and enforcement efforts , if this is done in a way that will effectively change the ethical deliberation of potential perpetrators . Making perpetrators consider the fact that punishment is more likely , or more severe , can sometimes be the best way to improve their moral awareness . In making this observation , our approach helps remedy an additional limitation of the current literature , wherein nudges are seen as moving on a separate track in comparison to the classical command and control approach to regulation.199 Nudges are usually developed as extra-legal instruments and are seen as competing with more traditional command and control legal interventions.200 Our argument is that in ethically problematic situations , 197 THALER & SUNSTEIN , supra note 79 . 198 FELDMAN , supra note 2 , at 198\u20139 . 199 Orly Lobel , The Renew Deal : The Fall of Regulation and the Rise of Governance in Contemporary Legal Thought , 89 Minn.

Importantly , this may result in a regulatory focus quite different from what we currently observe . Behavioral ethics research shows that unethicality is most prevalent in situations where legal standards are vague,201 or misconduct is manifested in subtle , rather than obvious , violations and without identifiable victims.202 Therefore , enforcement should be targeted at situations which constitute societal blind spots , where many more people are likely to engage in wrongdoing , as opposed to clear- cut examples of misconduct in which far fewer people are likely to engage . III . THE PROMISE OF BIG DATA REGULATION Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented increase in the use of big data as a means to improve prediction and decision-making.203 Big data analytics are already being employed by a wide range of organizations , from finance and healthcare to law enforcement.204 As eloquently put by Julie Cohen , big data is both a technology and a process . The technology involves information processing hardware able to analyze vast quantities of data in very short times . The process entails the use of the technology to identify patterns in the data , establish data-driven predictions , and apply them further.205 The product of this procedure is an extreme form of amalgamated knowledge.206 Big data analytics necessitates large amounts of information , often measured in petabytes and consisting of tens of millions of distinct observations.207 Big data typically involves rapid data processing financial decisions , instead of more traditional regulatory means ) . 201 Constantine Boussalis , Yuval Feldman & Henry E.

Current applications of big data include spam and fraud detection , credit score assignment , insurance pricing , as well as data-driven policing and law enforcement.208 In the context of law enforcement , big data is used for a wide range of purposes , including individual and geographical predictions of gun violence209 and other serious crimes.210 This Part explores the advantages of big data analytics in terms of its ability to curb the ills of bounded ethicality . We propose a use of big data never before developed in the literature , and still underused by regulators . We propose the use of big data not only in policing efforts designed to prevent severe crimes , but mainly for predicting other types of misconduct which arise not from violent tendencies , but from the bounded ethicality of potential perpetrators . We show that the characteristics and advantages of big data regulation make it particularly suited to achieving this goal . In the following sections , we highlight some of the new capabilities that big data analytics can offer to policy makers , as described in the growing literature on data-driven law enforcement . We then show that these newly found abilities can help address the challenges raised by bounded ethicality , as described in Part II above . A. Predictive Regulation The proliferation of big data analysis represents a paradigm shift in the general approach to the use of information . In the past , information was gathered and analyzed after the fact in response to past events , and not in anticipation of future developments.211 In the context of law enforcement , this shift represents a change in focus from investigation efforts after a crime has been committed to the effort to predict misconduct before the fact.212 Using big data analysis to help predict misconduct before the fact 208 Sarah Brayne , Big Data Surveillance : The Case of Policing , 82 ( 5 ) L. & SOC \u2019 Y REV . 977 , 980 ( 2017 ) . 209 Andrew V.

Ferguson , Big Data and Predictive Reasonable Suspicion , 63 ( 2 ) U. PA. L. REV . 327 , 369 ( 2015 ) ( reviewing the shift from inquiry to predictive policing ) . Big Data & Bounded Ethicality 1/1/2019 provides the tools needed for dealing with bounded ethicality and engaging with the awareness of potential perpetrators in real time . If regulators are increasingly able to produce reliable predictions regarding possible misconduct , they can trigger deliberation by possible wrongdoers before they act and offer alerts reminding them of the effects of their behaver or of possible sanctions in real time . Users of alert-based systems , whether regulators or potential perpetrators themselves , can receive real-time notifications when variables that are predictive of misconduct appear in the data . This is made possible by the high frequency of observations and the speed of data processing . The move towards data-driven enforcement thereby supplies , for the first time , the basic framework necessary for facing the regulatory challenge posed by bounded ethicality . B . Targeted Regulation Data-driven law enforcement allows regulators and policy makers to focus their efforts and initiate regulatory interventions that target specific risks and behaviors . This represents a shift from a random check mentality to a targeted intervention approach . That is , instead of deploying enforcement efforts randomly , law enforcers can use data analysis to direct their activity towards the focal points of criminal activity.213 In the context of bounded ethicality , this newfound ability is crucial for overcoming the danger of ethical numbing discussed above.214 To improve ethical deliberation , regulatory intervention must be targeted and specific , rather than general and broad . For example , ethical alerts are effective only if they are targeted and rare , rather than routine and constant . If everyone is randomly bombarded with ethical messages , those messages will quickly lose their meaning and impact.215 More generally , targeted intervention is necessary , as it is almost impossible to generate a general , rather than a temporary , improvement in people \u2019 s ethical capacities.216 Big data analysis offers a crucial advantage here , as it facilitates a regulatory scheme that only becomes operative when analysis of background information indicates that its involvement is necessary .

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "& Kern , supra note 52 , at 85 . 1/1/2019 Feldman & Kaplan Big data analysis offers an abundance of information regarding multiple observations.217 This information can guide policy makers when choosing the most appropriate regulatory response for each specific case . In this , the advantages of data-driven law enforcement can provide tools to overcome the challenge of choosing the right tools to effectively trigger deliberation and address bounded ethicality . This will be crucial in determining the most appropriate legal response , according to the nature of the ethical bias preventing candid deliberation . There are two primary ways to use data analysis for uncovering the cognitive sources of unethicality . First , these cognitive mechanisms might be observed directly through big data analysis of existing cases of misconduct . Big data analysis can provide a plethora of information on specific cases of misconduct , in a way that will enable regulators to devise the most appropriate regulatory response . As mentioned above , behavioral ethics research highlights the great diversity of enforcement means , and their suitability for different types of situations and for different types of ethical biases . For example , big data analysis could help clarify whether the likely offender in a given situation is driven by lack of ethical motivation or by lack of ethical awareness . Situations in which many of the likely transgressors are first-time offenders are more likely to be characterized by ethical blind spots relative to situations in which the transgressor is a repeat protagonist , making the possibility of unfamiliarity with the ethical problem of the behavior less likely . Moreover , using big data , we can also learn the transgression history of the most common transgressors and recognize the most suitable ethical nudges . Essentially , the history of the violations of the typical transgressor could be used to generate better predictions not just of the situational characteristics where we expect increased levels of unethical behavior , but also of the characteristics of the interventions which will be effective , based on their past efficacy across different situations . Second , policy makers may be able to determine indirectly which mechanism is operative by using big data analysis together with an approach of experimental regulation.218 In this experimental approach , different interventions , designed to overcome different types of biases and chosen from a large menu of mechanisms used to improve deliberation , will be deployed randomly . In the second stage , big the first stage of 217 Sarah Brayne , Big Data Surveillance : The Case of Policing , 82 ( 5 ) L. & SOC \u2019 Y REV . 977 , 980 ( 2017 ) . 218 The more common term is experimental legislation ( see Sofia Ranchordas , The Whys and Woes of Experimental Legislation , 1 ( 3 ) THEORY & PRAC .

In both cases , the term refers to the idea that policy makers should aspire to evaluate the effects of legislation or regulation either prior to or after their implementation ( Id . at 417 ) . Big Data & Bounded Ethicality 1/1/2019 data analysis will be used , for a second time , to evaluate the effectiveness of the different measures that were used and find those that proved most effective . This information , together with behavioral ethics research findings , can help policymakers infer the cognitive sources of unethicality and fine tune the type of regulatory intervention going forward . Randomized content can use the protocols of experimental design and their varying effects using big data analysis . After randomized messages are deployed , big data analysis can provide insights into the effectiveness of each one . Thus , in some cases , reminding perpetrators of possible legal sanctions may be the most effective route , while in other cases , it may be more productive to remind them of the harms their actions can cause others . Note that such reminders may also refer to the potential penalty for violation of a duty or a breach of the obligation to signal the true value of a good . Adding references to legal sanctions may help people recognize that their true self-interest lies in overcoming their tendency to deceive themselves.219 D. Integrated Datasets An important feature of big data is the integration of data from previously separate institutional sources.220 Law enforcement has always been data-driven to an extent . That is , police have traditionally used limited data sets , documenting finger prints , past convictions , or other relevant information.221 The move towards big data entails the merging of information from multiple sources and its systematic and integrated analysis.222 Such an integrated system allows users to track disparate data points in relation to one another and study correlations between data points originating in different datasets . The move towards integrated data is especially relevant in light of behavioral ethics findings . Behavioral ethics research emphasizes that misconduct and unethicality do not originate solely with abnormally malevolent individuals , but also with ordinary , respectable people . This 219 Feldman & Halali , supra note 181 , at 65 ( showing that reminders with ethical content and reminders regarding possible sanctions can yield similar effects in improving behavior ) . 220 Andrew G.

Rather , to prevent unethical conduct , law enforcers and regulators will need access to information regarding the antecedents of misconduct by all people . This accords with the move towards integrated data.223 Traditionally , law enforcers used datasets that include information on individuals who have previously been arrested or convicted of crimes . The recent move towards big data law enforcement entails a departure from this tradition , in favor of the inclusion of information on those with no prior contact with law enforcement authorities.224 Policy makers can now regulate also people with no prior encounters with the law , which is crucial in light of the understanding that bounded ethicality is universal . Such an integrated approach can be illustrated through recent work by Cantalupo & Kidder , who utilized the latest advances in data availability to analyze and categorize sexual harassment by university faculty members.225 They use a database drawn from media reports,226 federal civil rights investigations by the United States Departments of Education and Justice , 227 lawsuits by students alleging sexual harassment , 228 and lawsuits by tenure-track faculty fired for sexual harassment.229 More generally , many types of databases are now available for integrated , data-driven law enforcement ; any dataset documenting and recording misconduct or dispute can be a relevant source of information . First , databases currently used and maintained by law enforcement agencies can prove helpful in identifying patterns of unethicality.230 Existing law enforcement datasets have grown increasingly rich and detailed,231 now offering data points measured in the trillions even before 223 Andrew G.

Second , datasets maintained by regulators or consumer protection agencies may also prove useful . For example , in the context of financial regulation , the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , and other regulatory bodies hold extensive records on unethical behavior , as do the Federal Trade Commission \u2019 s Bureau of Consumer Protection and other bodies dealing with consumer complaints .

Fourth , valuable information about disputes can be gleaned from online dispute resolution ( ODR ) records . Since the 1990s , online markets have developed their own dispute resolution systems operating alongside , and sometimes instead of , more traditional systems of adjudication.239 These new systems manage an enormous volume of disputes , which are usually fully documented online.240 Tapping into these datasets would enable an analysis of those situations that typically give rise to legal disputes following some type of misconduct . Relevant datasets include those maintained by eBay 's Resolution Center , Amazon , or any other major online sellers . The analysis of the information might show which types of products or services are more likely to generate disputes . From a legal perspective , there is currently no difference between misrepresentation in selling a used car or in selling a used toy . However , from a behavioral perspective , such differences can be expected to exist , and some transactions , for example , those with more ambiguous definitions of what needs to be revealed to the buyers , are likely to lead sellers to more readily engage in motivated reasoning and justify or ignore unethical behavior . The use of big data analysis can reveal such trends , which will allow for the deployment of appropriate regulatory tools .

E. The Strength of Data-Driven Interventions A final relevant feature of data-driven law enforcement is its increased effectiveness . Regulatory interventions based on big data analysis are recognized as more potent , since their use is much better guided than traditional enforcement steps.243 This can be crucial in improving the effectiveness of ethical nudges , and facilitate a much necessary advance in regulating bounded ethicality . As mentioned above , improving moral deliberation is a particularly tricky task . Traditional nudges are aimed at helping people make better decisions for themselves . As such , nudges are aligned with the interests of the individuals being nudged , and are therefore easy to accept . Conversely , ethical nudges are designed to make people ignore their own self-interest or consider the interests of others.244 Therefore , people encountering ethical nudges might object to or reject them . The same mechanisms of bounded ethicality that led to misconduct in the first place can now be used as people ignore ethical nudges and their messages .

The Existing Personalized Law Approach Big data law enforcement is currently closely tied to the concept of personalized law,251 which involves more nuanced legal responses tailored to the personal characteristics of specific individuals . The current thinking is that the natural development of big data analysis , and law enforcement generally , is towards a more personalized future , where enforcement efforts will be directed towards specific individuals.252 The personalized law approach therefore upends the fundamental feature of the legal system : that the law treats all individuals equally and thus aspires to be objective and impersonal.253 Traditionally , many legal 251 Andrew G.

These \u201c one size fit all \u201d standards structure the law according to some general and objective point of reference.255 Recently , scholars have started to question this basic framework and to call for the more personalized application of legal standards.256 They argue for the use of big data analysis to set legal standards that are tailored more precisely to each specific individual . Thus , the actions of a tortfeasor should not be measured against the general and objective standard of the reasonable person \u201d but rather against that of a reasonable self . That is , the court should be asked to verify whether or not the tortfeasor behaved in a way that can be considered reasonable for him or her , considering all personal abilities and limitations.257 Scholars have also pointed out that this approach is not entirely alien to existing legal practices and , in fact , has always existed alongside the traditional position based on an objective and impersonal approach.258 Given the much greater availability and verifiability of information about individuals today , these scholars advocate towards more finely calibrated tilt that subjectivity.259 the balance should now The personalized law approach uses big data to discern individual characteristics and then to apply a more nuanced type of law tailored to the needs and"}]}

In practical terms , bounded ethicality typically originates with the existence of a situational moral blind spot . 1 . The Mechanics of Situational Regulation Moral blind spots are not always operative , and their presence depends on a host of factors that can converge , creating situations in which individuals \u2019 moral judgement is more easily impaired . Thus , some behavioral ethics experiments have identified situations in which up to 80 percent of people were found to lie.291 More significantly , behavioral ethics research shows that unethicality is highly predictable based on situational factors.292 Therefore , the best way to identify focal points of unethicality is by targeting suspect situations , rather than suspect individuals . Focusing on the typical transgressor across different situations rather than on individual variation , which is based on the past behavior of individuals , offers several advantages.293 Because individuals have a limited ability to monitor their own behavior , situational factors play a larger role in prompting them to commit wrongdoing than is traditionally assumed in 288 Samuel R.

More generally , the more information we have about the situational causes of unethicality , the more likely it becomes that targeted situational regulation will effectively reduce it .

By utilizing big data analytics , policy makers can predict unethicality and then deploy targeted regulatory responses in real time in order to improve ethical deliberation by potential perpetrators . The use of targeted ethical reminders can improve ethical decision-making , without running the risk of creating ethical numbing and over bombarding people with meaningless and random ethical messages . Big data analysis can also help tailor the most appropriate regulatory response to each specific case , and match it to the specific bias that is creating the opportunity for unethical conduct . This paper identifies the advantages of using big data analytics as a platform for curbing bounded ethicality , and also recommends important alterations in the way big data is currently used by law enforcers . Thus , we advocate a shift in the use of big data from a personalized to a situational approach . This move can render the use of big data more effective , in light of behavioral ethics findings that suggest that problematic situations , or moral blind spots , are often stronger predictors of unethicality are interpersonal variations .

Stanford Computational Antitrust VOL . 1 Introduction Antitrust 1.0 appeared in 1890 with the Sherman Act and was introduced in Europe with the Treaty of Rome in 1957 . It has been shaped by several schools of thought ( antitrust 1.1 for the Brandeis School , antitrust 1.2 for the Roosevelt School ... ) , but always within the framework of a textual interpretation . Antitrust 2.0 then came along with the Chicago School in the early 1960s ( antitrust 2.1 being the Harvard School , antitrust 2.2 the post-Chicago School ... ) . Antitrust law became more economical to fit with the dynamic sectors falling within its scope . The method matched the subject matter . Antitrust 3.0 is emerging but remains incomplete . It appeared in the early 2010s when antitrust agencies have shifted their focus on the issues related to the digital economy . But while there are passionate discussions about the practices implemented by digital players , the use of technological tools to address them is very little debated . This disconnection between diagnosis and treatment is becoming problematic . Antitrust agencies struggle to remedy anticompetitive practices in increasingly complex , fast-paced , and evolutive markets . Soon , firms will also suffer from this struggle leading to fewer decisions and well-informed guidelines . Legal certainty will decrease while the number of judicial errors will be on the rise . Against this background , one must increase antitrust law with new technologies to make antitrust 3.0 complete . Enters \u201c computational antitrust. \u201d"}]}

I . What is Computational Antitrust ? First , this article discusses the core idea and concepts behind computational law ( A ) , after which it introduces computational antitrust ( B ) . As one shall explain , the challenges encountered by the jurists , philosophers , and mathematicians in computational law matters are also found in computational antitrust . A \u2013 Computational Law Computational law is a \u201c branch of legal informatics concerned with the mechanization of legal analysis ( whether done by humans or machines ) . \u201d 2 Computational law is today a subject of growing enthusiasm,3 although the idea to compute the law is centuries old . German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz ( 1646\u20131716 ) , known for his defense of rationalism , argued in the 17th century that each legal question has a single answer.4 From then on , \u201c if controversies were to arise , there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than 1 See for more information about the Computational Antitrust project at Stanford University , CodeX Center ( The Stanford Center for Legal Informatics ) . 2 Michael Genesereth , Computational Law : The Cop in the Backseat ( 2015 ) .

For it would suffice for them to take their pencils in their hands and to sit down at the abacus and say to each other ( with a friend if they wish ) : Let us calculate. \u201d 5 Other philosophers like Jeremy Bentham also argued that codifying the law would help make it more practical and accessible6\u2014which Emperor Napoleon did in France.7 With that in mind , Leibniz and his descendants always faced the difficulty of codifying the entire law , which , being the product of natural languages , could not be fully consolidated . Today , digital technologies give new life to these ambitions aspiring to mechanize the rule of law in its entirety ( enforcement included ) .8 Of course , technologies are subject to combinatorial evolution , making it very difficult to forecast which form they will take.9 One can nonetheless imagine a world in which artificial intelligence ( \u201c AI \u201d ) 10 and blockchain combined with quantum computing will soon provide valuable support by enabling a better understanding of the world \u2019 s complexity , and eventually , capturing part"}]}

B \u2013 Computational Antitrust Markets are becoming increasingly complex and dynamic in today \u2019 s economy.15 This complicates the task of antitrust agencies , each day a little more . Against this background , the implementation of computational methods is becoming necessary to maintain and improve antitrust agencies \u2019 ability to detect , analyze , and remedy anticompetitive practices.16 These tools and methods are rarely used in antitrust law today , in fact , most antitrust agencies are just beginning to acquire the technical expertise to develop and use them . Eventually , computational tools should be widely adopted and allow the integration of more variables in anticompetitive cases , whether from economic theory , business and management science , computer science , statistics , or behavioral insights.17 These tools will also simplify merger control , freeing up some of the teams within each antitrust agency .

The more documents there are , the greater the uncertainty considering that agencies may face great complexity during the analytical process.34 For example , the European Commission has examined over 2.7 million documents in the merger between Bayer and Monsanto.35 The Department of Justice has been facing similar issues.36 These difficulties in processing all the data ( in the allotted time ) is problematic considering that data are the backbone of merger analysis.37 Computational antitrust could then prove helpful by providing agencies with the tools to analyze extensive data sets within the time constraint.38 Second , companies are very much in charge of the data being sent\u2014as there are no injunctions to produce specific records , no dawn raids , and no discovery procedures ( where applicable ) . It creates a first asymmetry between companies and agencies . For example , the European Commission underlined in Dow/DuPont that \u201c the Parties did not mention their internal databases on crop protection patents and did not provide their competitive intelligence reports on competitors \u2019 crop protection patents in their responses to several initial Commission \u2019 s requests for information. \u201d 39 This made the analysis more \u201c difficult \u201d than it should have been.40 At times , this asymmetry even leads to questioning the integrity of the data . In the WhatsApp case , for instance , the Commission imposed a \u20ac110 million sanction on Facebook for providing misleading information.41 Once the agency has received the data , it processes it without sending it back to the companies.42 That triggers a second asymmetry , thus making merger procedures more obscure than they could be . Computational antitrust could fix these asymmetries by introducing a systematized communication tool between companies and antitrust agencies . It could ensure that companies send ( in real- time ) agencies all information in specified databases and that firms get access to it 34 Rupprecht Podszun & Sarah Langenstein , Data as an Input in Competition Law Cases : Standards , Difficulties and Biases in EU Merger Control , in LEGAL CHALLENGES OF BIG DATA ( Cannataci , Falce & Pollicino eds. , 2020 ) 174 , 182"}]}

After sanctions have been imposed , the ( automatic ) collection of market data could , for example , provide valuable information on their effectiveness , whether they are strictly monetary or also including structural and behavioral remedies.51 They could also better estimate consumer savings thanks to their decisions and orient them accordingly.52 Furthermore , antitrust agencies could systematically audit their processes to ensure they stay effective in a fast-changing technological environment.53 Finally , they could carry out empirical studies of specific industries,54 for example , to understand what conditions have allowed the emergence of new players when the market was deemed to have tipped.55 Second , computational antitrust will be predictive . Most of the laws passed in a majority of countries undergo a cost-benefit evaluation . The development of computational methods will help simulate the effects of new public policies and legislation , thus making the assessment more accurate while complying with what Jean Tirole called the requirement of \u201c information-light \u201d policies.56 Although it is illusory to believe that one will soon attain a perfect simulation of reality , these methods will allow policymakers and regulators to be better informed.57 Here again , both companies and agencies will benefit from computational antitrust deployment as long as one considers its limits ( see below ) . 9 , 2020 ) archived www.leconcurrentialiste.com/william-kovacic-ftc-google/ , 49 FTC ,"}]}

The Challenges of Computational Antitrust Computational antitrust is coming . This simple observation does not mean that one should adopt a passive ( some would say defeatist ) attitude . On the contrary , several challenges deserve one \u2019 s full attention . Some are common to ( the use of ) computational methods in all legal fields ( A ) , while others are specific to computational antitrust ( B ) . Eventually , they come down to human issues rather than technological ones ( C ) . A \u2013 General Challenges to Computational Law In the coming years , computational law will be the subject of a growing number of fantasies and criticisms . The further computational law will infiltrate our institutions , the greater those fantasies and criticisms will become.58 Often , the careful observer will find the concept of control at the heart of these reactions . Those who believe computers can do better than humans in all matters have been utterly enthusiastic about transferring control from humans to machines . The opposite is also true ; algorithms and AI have been described as a \u201c black box \u201d to denounce their supposedly obscure decision-making processes.59 Transparency will be the referee\u2014showing the nuts and bolts , stressing the possibilities , the limits , and actual functioning of computational antitrust . Of course , not all the data used and generated by computational tools should be publicly available , but perhaps processes and mechanisms should be . Contrary to human decision-making , one can reveal the working of computational decision- making.60 In other words , the process of computation does not have to be a black box . Human reasoning is \u201c noisy , \u201d but computation does not have to be ; 61 after all , computational tools are what we decide to build . If transparency is an important value , one can design computational tools that emphasize it . 58 For example , artificial intelligence will allow the automation of many tasks , see Harry Surden , Machine Learning and Law , 89 WASH. L. REV . 87 , 88 ( 2014 ) ( \u201c there may be a limited , but not insignificant , subset of legal tasks that are capable of being partially automated using current Al techniques despite their limitations relative to human cognition \u201d ) .

The first is about guaranteeing the many human rights currently recognized and enforced.62 Computational tools must not put them at risk . For example , procedural fairness ought to be maintained despite the use of sophisticated tools by one party only.63 One will have to define a new framework for the admissibility of the evidence produced by these tools .

Karl Popper \u2019 s work will be valuable in this regard.64 The second item relates to using computational methods for ensuring the effectiveness of different rights that are still being disregarded ( in practice ) or denied . For example , legal scholars have been documenting discriminatory court decisions and legislation.65 If the decision-making becomes transparent , and if the data is duly secured using an architecture designed for the purpose , computational tools will be positioned to reduce these unfortunate outcomes . Indeed , one will be able to identify when and how human rights have been infringed66 and assign liability on that basis.67 For these reasons , transparency seems to be a prerequisite for the broad adoption of computational tools.68 B \u2013 Challenges Specific to Computational Antitrust Computational antitrust is also facing specific challenges . The first relates to developing the right tools . It implies coding antitrust laws and rulings to create efficient methods for ( consistently ) assessing compliance with them . It also implies helping agencies to automate enforcement and merger control procedures . Subsequently , one will be required to engage in the actual development of these tools and test which ones are most adapted to automating different parts of antitrust law . This testing is one of computational antitrust top priorities\u2014it should lead to rapid results . The second is tied to data , and , in the end , to their scope . To identify which data ( and data structures ) companies and agencies will need to feed the above tools , one 62 See Delipetrev , supra note 11 , at 21 ( identifying four ethical principles : ( i ) respect for human autonomy , ( ii ) prevention of harm , ( iii ) fairness , ( iv ) explainability ) . 63 Bonin & Malhi , supra note 23 , at 471 ( underlining that legal procedures in European law must comply with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the principle of \u201c equality of arms \u201d ) . 64 See , in particular , KARL POPPER , CONJECTURES AND REFUTATIONS : THE GROWTH OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ( 2002 ) . 65 See Jonathan P.

On the subject , the First and Fourth Amendments already oblige the U.S. government to provide open access to the information it is creating ( using computational tools or not ) . This implies making the processing transparent . Making it obscure would be a missed opportunity . \u201c Computational Antitrust \u201d will be required to address the objective ( s ) of computational antitrust . It appears that the use of computational tools for retrospective analysis and the making of counterfactuals is a logical application69 while predictive analysis is more debatable in the field of antitrust . To be sure , our ability to measure variables is increasing over the decades . Patterns are discernible , and regularities can be deduced from a real-world phenomenon , making it increasingly possible to use predictive tools to measure the effects of antitrust laws , decisions , and related policies over specific variables ( translating the objective ( s ) of antitrust agencies ) .70 That being said , computational tools ( as others ) are poorly suited for predicting all the forces in the economy.71 They do not lead to a \u201c theory of everything. \u201d 72 Quantum computing will help to integrate more variables . Combined with AI systems , quantum computers will better identify the reasons for economic growth . And yet , one should not be under the impression that it will be possible to capture the entire world around us in a computer program\u2014at least , not anytime soon.73 On that basis , one should doubt whether computational antitrust could justify ex- ante regulations and other market design objectives.74 In fact , one could even argue that , by allowing a faster and more accurate enforcement of antitrust laws , computational tools will reduce the need for ex-ante regulations . In this sense , perhaps the curious task of computational antitrust will be \u201c to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design. \u201d 75 The third is tied"}]}

It is not the invention of tools , however subtle , complex , or powerful , that constitutes man \u2019 s greatest achievement , but the ability to use the tools that man has developed within himself. \u201d 81 Providing this challenge a satisfying answer will require West Coast Code and East Coast Code to cooperate.82 This collaboration requires coders ( computer scientists , data scientists , developers ) and the antitrust community ( companies , policymakers , regulators ) to prepare their respective fields so computational antitrust can thrive . Coders will be required to devote their time to developing the recipes\u2014the programming of sequences of specific instructions to achieve a specific result . Companies and agencies will provide the ingredients\u2014which requires identifying the ones needed and how to get them ( i.e. , how to transform data into information ) . In the end , these recipes and ingredients will complement each other ; the nature of one will change the nature of the other . Institutional changes will facilitate the cooperation of these two communities . Several actions are required in this regard . First , one will be required to create proper incentives for computational antitrust development . On the side of coders , computer scientists , and data scientists , this implies the creation of different reward systems to ensure they get ( and stay ) involved in the field . On the side of companies and agencies , this requires enlarging the teams dedicated to these subjects and giving them appropriate means.83 Second , one will have to establish the conditions 78 Salil K.

In addition , risk assessments are made for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high risk sex , terrorism and violent offenders to ensure the safety and protection of the community and to promote their rehabilitation ( for example , Crimes ( High Risk Offenders ) Act 2006 ( NSW ) s 3 ( 1 ) ) . Such risk assessments have traditionally been the function of the human discretion and intuition of judicial officers , based on clinical assessments , framed by legislation and common law principles , and encapsulating the concept of individualised justice ( Markarian v The Queen [ 2005 ] HCA 25 ; Muldrock v The Queen [ 2011 ] HCA 39 ; Bugmy v The"}]}

Human judicial evaluative functions are increasingly complemented by a range of actuarial , algorithmic , machine learning and Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) tools that purport to provide accurate predictive capabilities , and objective and consistent assessments of risk ( Barabas et al . 2017 ) . But ethical and human rights concerns have been raised globally regarding algorithms as proprietary products , potentially with in- built statistical bias as well as the diminution of judicial human evaluation in favour of the machine ( Dawson et al . 2019 ; Angwin et al . 2016 ; Barabas et al . 2017 ; European Commission 2019 ; Wexler 2017 ) . A recent report from England and Wales found there was \u2018 a lack of explicit standards , best practice , and openness or transparency about the use of algorithmic systems in criminal justice \u2019 ( Law Society 2019 : 4 ) . It is in this context that the need for ethical and human rights-based AI frameworks in Australia has been recently recognised ( Dawson et al . 2019 ; AHRC 2018 ) . Actuarial models , algorithms and AI frame a growing number of technologies used in criminal justice , for instance , in automated decisions , predictive policing and facial recognition ( Law Society 2019 ) . This article will focus on risk assessment and what happens when decision-making is delegated to a predictive tool . Specifically , this article will scrutinise the inscrutable proprietary nature of such risk tools and how the calculation of the risk score may be rendered opaque and unknowable to both the offender and the court . This is a significant area to explore given that the decision points in criminal procedure where algorithmic instruments may be applied , represent the ultimate high stakes determination of liberty versus detention in a situation of extreme power imbalance ( Barabas et al . 2017 ; Eckhouse et al . 2019 ; Law Society 2019 ) . This article commences with an analysis of risk in the context of an increasingly risk-averse society and criminal justice system , and the tensions between a general right to be at liberty versus community safety . In the next section , the article examines criticisms levelled at human judicial discretion , particularly in the context of sentencing . Flowing from this discussion , the article provides an overview of the development of predictive tools in risk assessments in criminal procedure to question whether machine and data-driven assessments offer more accuracy and objectivity than human judges .

The application of statistical , data-based instruments in deterministic criminal procedures may transgress the presumption of innocence in bail applications , breach individualised justice in sentencing and parole , further constrain or displace judicial discretion , and diminish procedural justice . Risk , Unacceptable Risk and Protecting the Community The assessment of risk has become a critical element of the criminal justice system from law enforcement through to pre- and post-trial procedures including bail and sentencing as well as in decisions regarding an offender \u2019 s release back into the community or continuing detention or extended supervision ( Carlson 2017 ; Harcourt 2005 ) . Recent case law demonstrates judicial engagement with risk-related terminology including risk management , risk profile , risk factors , risk associated behaviour , and risk of recidivism . Case law also reveals how courts gauge concepts such as unacceptable risk , high risk , and risk to community safety . What is \u2018 risk \u2019 and why has it become a focal point in criminal justice ? Scholars have identified the increasing emphasis on \u2018 dangerousness , risk , pre- emption and uncertainty \u2019 so that precaution and risk prevention have become dominant forces in the administration of justice , perhaps privileging \u2018 generalised fears \u2019 and potential harms over \u2018 real threats \u2019 ( Brown et al . 2015 : 43-44 ) . In our risk society ( Beck 1992 ) , risk is a \u2018 core organising concept \u2019 ( McSherry 2004 : 1 ) and there is a clear political context that frames debates regarding law and order ( Brown and Quilter 2014 ) as well as moral panics ( Lee 2007 ) leading to the increased significance of risk assessment and tightening of legislative , policing and procedural measures . The concept of risk has justified the extension of criminal responsibility to behaviours associated with consorting , planning acts of terrorism , status offences such as being the member of an outlaw motor cycle gang , and has fuelled new forms of post-sentence supervision and preventive detention ( Brown et al . 2015 ) . The spread of criminal law \u2019 s dominion over possible future harms and inchoate or preparatory criminality may be analysed as \u2018 risk-neutralization \u2019 or preventive justice on the one hand while on the other , as diminishing the rule of law and presumption of innocence ( O \u2019 Malley 2013 : 276 ; Zedner 2007 ; Husak 2008 ; Brown et al . 2015 ) . Risk assessments are undertaken at various criminal procedure decision points including at bail , sentencing and parole . Pending trial , an accused person may be held on remand and using NSW as an example , courts consider the composite phrase \u2018 unacceptable risk \u2019 , that is , an unacceptable risk that the accused person , if released from custody"}]}

Predicting such risk is \u2018 context specific \u2019 ( Lynn v State of New South Wales [ 2016 ] NSWCA 57 , Beazley P at [ 74 ] ) , complex and controversial given that \u2018 it is trite to observe that no grant of bail is risk free \u2019 ( R v Elzamtar [ 2017 ] NSWSC 275 , Harrison J at [ 23 ] ) . That is , the bail decision does not rest on the elimination of risk , nor probabilities of the risk , rather : What must be established is that there is a sufficient likelihood of the occurrence of the risk which , having regard to all relevant circumstances , makes it unacceptable . Hence the possibility an offender may commit like offences has been viewed as sufficient to satisfy a court that there is an unacceptable risk . ( Haidy v DPP [ 2004 ] VSC 247 , Redlich J at [ 16 ] ) . Whether a risk is unacceptable is contentious ( R v Agang ; R v Bajwa ; R v Ghanem [ 2017 ] NSWSC 138 ) as noted by Harrison J at [ 17 ] : I accept that the existence of a risk and the assessment of whether or not it is unacceptable are matters about which minds may differ\u2026Inevitably and too often one is required to make the determination based only on contested inferences from the past and frail predictions about the future . This observation highlights the complexity of pre-trial \u2018 frail predictions \u2019 , signals possible inconsistencies between judges and may offer an insight as to why statistical risk assessment tools are being adopted throughout many jurisdictions ( Koepke and Robinson 2018 ) . Risk assessments and \u2018 predictions of future criminality \u2019 ( ALRC 2005 : 51 ) in sentencing can arise in a number of other circumstances . Certainly , one purpose of sentencing is to protect the community from the offender and incapacitation through incarceration eliminates the risk of re-offending while the offender is detained . Risk is also significant when making an Intensive Correction Order ( ICO ) , a form of custodial sentence served in the community . The paramount consideration in making such an order is community safety and , in this evaluation , the court is to address the offender \u2019 s risk of reoffending ( see for example Crimes ( Sentencing Procedure ) Act 1999 ( NSW ) ss 7 , 66 ) . In the general sentencing context , the Veen series of cases provides a compelling examination of the risk of recidivism , public protection , preventive detention as well as indefinite detention ( McSherry 2004 ; Veen ( no . 1 ) ("}]}

Risk assessment may be a critical function within the prison system too , for example , in the security classification of inmates , identifying inmates \u2019 risks and criminogenic needs , and in offender management ( Law Society 2019 ; Moore 2015 ) . Risk assessments are also fundamental at the other end of criminal process \u2013 when an offender may be eligible to be released from a custodial situation on parole back into the community . In effect , parole means that the offender may serve the remainder of their sentence in the community subject to supervision and strict conditions . In parole determinations , risk to community safety is central as well as risk of reoffending , risks to the offender and risks to other persons ( see for example Crimes ( Administration of Sentences ) Act 1999 ( NSW ) Part 6 ; ss 128 , 130 ; Crimes ( Administration of Sentences ) Regulation 2014 ( NSW ) Parts 14 , 14A ) . Regarding high risk offenders and the imposition of extended supervision orders ( a mode of supervising an offender in the community at the expiration of their custodial sentence ) or continuing detention orders ( a form of preventative , protective and indeterminate detention beyond the custodial sentence period ) , courts must consider the composite phrase \u2018 unacceptable risk \u2019 ( see for example Crimes ( High Risk Offenders ) Act 2006 ( NSW ) ) . This is done in the context of \u2018 making the community secure from harm as opposed to guaranteeing its safety and protection\u2026were it otherwise , every risk would be unacceptable \u2019 ( Lynn v State of New South Wales [ 2016 ] NSWCA 57 , Beazley P at [ 61 ] my emphasis ) . This requires a consideration of firstly , \u2018 the probability that the risk will manifest \u2019 and secondly , the seriousness of the potential harm ( State of NSW v Ceissman [ 2018 ] NSWSC 508 , Rothman J at [ 26 ] ) . The assessment of the unacceptability of any risk \u2018 involves at least notionally the arithmetical product of the consequences of the risk should it eventuate on the one hand and the likelihood that it will eventuate on the other hand \u2019 ( State of New South Wales v Pacey ( Final ) [ 2015 ] NSWSC 1983 Harrison J at [ 43 ] ) . Given the close affiliation with between calculations of dangerousness ( Hobbs and Trotter 2018 ) , risk assessments and arithmetic predictions , the rise of statistical , actuarial or algorithmic evaluation is not surprising .

The public and media not infrequently express frustration with sentencing decisions which seem too lenient , unfair or inconsistent with other decisions ( Zdenkowski 2000 ) . Scholars , too , critique the levels of unpredictability and numerical inconsistency in sentencing decisions ( Stobbs et al . 2017 ; Krasnostein and Freiberg 2013 ) . However , many decisions made throughout criminal justice are premised upon the concept of individualised justice and the exercise of human discretion : from police officers \u2019 discretion to arrest , to judicial discretion in granting or denying release to bail , to sentencing and to the post-sentence orders that may be made in relation to high risk offenders . The principle of individualised justice is responsive to the individual offender , the facts and the offence ( Anthony et al . 2015 ) and embraces the notion that \u2018 there is no greater inequality than the equal treatment of unequals \u2019 ( Dennis v United States 339 US 162 , 184 ( Frankfurter J ) ( 1950 ) ) . It ensures that the punishment fits the crime and the offender \u2019 s moral culpability ( R v Fernando ( 1992 ) 76 A Crim R 58 ; Bugmy v The Queen ( 2013 ) 249 CLR 571 ; Munda v Western Australia ( 2013 ) 249 CLR 600 ; Elias v The Queen ( 2013 ) 248 CLR 483 ) . This principle is particularly relevant in sentencing where the judiciary recognises that \u2018 the outcome of discretionary decision- making can never be uniform \u2019 ( Wong v The Queen [ 2001 ] HCA 54 , Gleeson CJ at [ 6 ] ) and there is no singular \u2018 correct \u2019 sentence ( Martin 2017 : 19 ) as every offender and offence is different ( Anthony et al . 2015 ) . There is , however , a proviso that \u2018 like cases should be treated in a like manner \u2019 ( Wong v The Queen [ 2001 ] HCA 54 , Gleeson CJ at [ 6 ] ) . Of course , the exercise of discretion in criminal justice is not completely unfettered with legislation , legal precedent and guidelines serving to delimit discretion ( Martin 2017 ) . For instance in sentencing , judges may be constrained by guideline judgments , mandatory minimum sentences , maximum penalties , the principles that imprisonment ought to be as a last resort , proscribed sentencing \u2018 discounts \u2019 , aggravating and mitigating factors and non-parole periods . Within this process , numerical consistency is less important than the consistent application of legal principles ( Hili v The Queen ( 2010 ) 242 CLR 520 ) . Ultimately in sentencing , judges are required to assess the appropriate sentence given the particular offence committed by the particular offender , while balancing objective and subjective factors with the purposes"}]}

This is a complex exercise in proportionality and giving weight to all the competing and multiple objectives of sentencing , a process referred to as \u2018 instinctive \u2019 or \u2018 intuitive \u2019 synthesis . Instinctive synthesis has been described as a global value judgment , recognised as not necessarily logical and a process that may produce \u2018 outcomes upon which reasonable minds will differ \u2019 ( Hudson v The Queen ( 2010 ) 30 VR 610 ; 205 A Crim R 199 ; [ 2010 ] VSCA 332 at [ 27 ] ) . However well the process of instinctive synthesis is articulated in sentencing judgments , it seems to many to be an opaque , arbitrary , unpredictable and perhaps overly subjective process ( Stobbs et al . 2017 ) . Would the procedure be more transparent and fair if instinctive synthesis and related risk assessments by humans were instead solved or structured by an algorithm , an AI judge ( Sourdin 2018 ) ? Stobbs et al . ( 2017 : 262 ) suggest that sentencing is amenable to being automated because it is premised upon established principles , weightings and key factors . AI is well suited to the complexities of calibrating multiple variables , if not presenting a means to improve and refine the sentencing system by incorporating algorithmic risk assessments and by removing the \u2018 subconscious bias \u2019 of humans . Likewise , vendors of predictive risk assessment tools promote them as the solution to human bias and an improvement on human judgment ( Eckhouse et al . 2019 ) . Non-human automated decision-making processes purport to make such assessments more consistent , timely , cost-effective and accurate ( Hogan-Doran 2017 ) . The Growth of the Algorithm The push-back against judicial subjectivity and discretion needs to be examined in the context of preventive justice ( Ashworth and Zedner 2014 ) as well as the rise of \u2018 actuarial justice \u2019 and the embedding of scientific discourse in criminal justice ( O \u2019 Malley 2013 : 276 ; Brown et al 2015 ; McSherry 2004 ) . While courts in some jurisdictions have been concerned with questions of offenders \u2019 current and future dangerousness , there have been definite shifts towards risk-based models and \u2018 statistical or actuarial risk prediction \u2019 ( McSherry 2004 : 2 ; Koepke and Robinson 2018 ) . At the outset , key terms need to be defined as there are various statistical , data-driven predictive tools used in criminal procedure risk assessments that are not strictly AI . Rather they are \u2018 actuarial \u2019 or \u2018 algorithmic \u2019 instruments . However , similar ethical concerns and challenges arise . Barabas et al . ( 2017 ) state that actuarial decision-making practices in risk assessment have been used since the 1920s"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ". According to Harcourt ( 2005 : 10 ) the term \u2018 actuarial \u2019 refers to the use of statistical methods\u2014rather than clinical methods\u2014on large datasets of criminal offending rates \u2026 to determine the different levels of offending associated with a group \u2026 and , based on those correlations , to predict first the past , present or future criminal behavior of a particular individual and to administer second a criminal justice outcome for that particular individual . Actuarial can also refer to the fact that the score is determined by an algorithm ( Smid 2014 ) . Algorithms can be understood in various ways such as relating to a defined computational procedure or set of instructions that takes a set of values as input and produces a set of values as output ( Law Society 2019 ) . In relation to criminal justice , an algorithm can be understood as a rule that uses numerical inputs to produce a prediction relevant to the procedural decision point ( Christin et al . 2015 ) . Algorithms operate in different ways and more advanced forms include machine learning whereby the machine \u2018 learns \u2019 , improves its tasks over time and may modify an algorithm as it synthesises new data ( Law Society 2019 : 10 ) . Regarding AI , it is suggested that there is \u2018 no universally accepted definition \u2019 ; it is an expression that encapsulates autonomous computerised processing of data that resembles or replicates human processing and intelligence ( AHRC 2018 : 26 ) . AI-informed decision-making and prediction occurs when algorithms are applied to datasets with tasks ranging from simple , narrow automated systems to more sophisticated \u2018 neural nets and deep learning \u2019 ( Dawson et al . 2019 : 14 ) . Prior to the uptake of actuarial or algorithmic techniques , risk was assessed in a clinical but human manner , for example , by psychiatrists or psychologists , based on professional , subjective evaluation ( Carlson 2017 ) , basically , \u2018 unstructured clinical judgements \u2019 ( Jones and Milton 2016 : 1 ; Hsu et al . 2009 ; Moore 2015 ) . Now this wholly human approach may be considered as overly subjective and lacking in reliability and consistency ( Jones and Milton 2016 ) . The various generations of risk assessment have developed through the actuarial or statistical approach and have aimed for a greater level of objectivity ( Hsu et al . 2009 ) . They were initially based on \u2018 static factors ( the need-to-know aspects of the offenders such as age at first offense and crime ( s ) committed ) \u2019 , then later combined with \u2018 dynamic factors ( the possibility of change in the offenders \u2019 lives ) \u2019 ( Hsu et al . 2009 : 729 ) , and more recently with other specific offender factors to enable treatment and intervention ( Moore 2015 ) .

Such instruments provide statistical predictions , typically comprising risk factors as predictors of violence or reoffending so that an individual is evaluated against these risk factors and \u2018 scored \u2019 \u2013 the higher the score , the higher the risk ( Carlson 2017 ; Grann and L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m 2007 ) . These predictive tools have permeated law enforcement and the criminal justice system ( Harcourt 2005 ) to become the norm in practice ( Smid 2014 ) , and \u2018 used as an objective , neutral mechanism of fair treatment \u2019 ( Eckhouse et al . 2019 : 3 ) . The instruments exude the veneer of objectivity and are used to score the risks of \u2018 flight , rearrest , parole violation\u2026based on data from other people with characteristics similar \u2019 ( Eckhouse et al . 2019 : 3 ) . In summary , it is clear that subjective risk assessments have increasingly given way to mechanical and actuarial tools that produce statistical models based on extensive criminal offending datasets , perceived to be more objective than human observation ( Carlson 2017 ) . Forms of predictive risk assessment are now applied at various decision points in criminal justice and \u2018 dominate the field of crime and punishment \u2019 such that there is an \u2018 actuarial turn \u2019 in criminal law ( Harcourt 2005 : 15 ) . Law enforcement agencies have adopted predictive algorithmic instruments for a number of risk assessment applications . For instance in England and Wales , the Harm Assessment Risk Tool ( HART ) , described as a \u2018 random forest algorithm \u2019 , is deployed in determining whether individuals should be arrested , charged or diverted ( Law Society 2019 : 46 ) . Suspects are risk-scored using a variety of other algorithmic tools and matrices that seek to identify propensities for particular forms of offending and future behaviours , while predictive systems are also used to identify risks of victimisation ( Law Society 2019 ) . In the sentencing context , pre-sentence reports routinely inform courts of the offender \u2019 s risk score ( Law Society 2019 ) . Predictive Tools in Action Recent NSW case law evidences the range of predictive , diagnostic tools including Level of Service Inventory - Revised ( LSI-R ) , the Risk Assessment Report , the STABLE-2007 tool , the STATIC Risk Factors Actuarial Assessment - Sex Offending ( STATIC-99R ) and the Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol ( RSVP ) . How can such emergent actuarial/algorithmic tools assist judicial officers in making decisions that impact a defendant \u2019 s or offender \u2019 s legal status and liberty ? Can criminal procedure decisions be partially or fully automated or , at least , structured by an algorithm ? In State of New South"}]}

In Barrie , the psychologist assessed his \u2018 risk of sexual reoffending using the STATIC-99R , which is an actuarial test applied in predicting the sexual recidivism for individuals charged with or convicted of sexual offences \u2019 ( State of New South Wales v Barrie ( Final ) [ 2018 ] NSWSC 1005 , N Adams J at [ 69 ] ) , a tool described in another case as having \u2018 moderate predictive accuracy \u2019 ( State of New South Wales v Graham James Kay [ 2018 ] NSWSC 1235 , Wilson J at [ 40 ] ) . Using the STATIC-99R tool , the offender in Barrie was assessed as a \u201c 7 \u201d placing him in the high risk category . The assessing psychologist in this case acknowledged the \u2018 limitations of this test and stated that a more comprehensive evaluation was obtained by reference to the RSVP ( Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol ) \u2019 ( State of New South Wales v Barrie ( Final ) [ 2018 ] NSWSC 1005 , N Adams J at [ 69 ] ) . The RSVP tool is a structured professional judgment instrument developed to assist in the identification and management of sexual violence using a range of factors identified by the literature related to sexual offending . It includes 22 static and dynamic factors grouped into five domains . Those five domains are : a history of sexual violence ; psychological adjustment ; mental disorder ; social adjustment ; and manageability . She concluded that the defendant presented with risk factors in all but one of those domains ( he [ did ] not have a mental disorder ) . She state [ d ] that this suggests that the STATIC-99R assessment of high risk is an accurate reflection of his risk . ( State of New South Wales v Barrie ( Final ) [ 2018 ] NSWSC 1005 , N Adams J at [ 69 ] ) . Here the psychologist used the RSVP tool , described as the most common Structured Professional Judgement instrument for high risk sexual offenders , as a means to structure the human risk assessor \u2019 s process of evaluation rather than replace that person ( Jones and Milton 2016 ) .

One actuarial assessment instrument used was the Level of Service Inventory - Revised ( LSI-R ) that identifies an offender \u2019 s risk of reoffending and their criminogenic needs ( Watkins 2011 ) . LSI-R is described as a third generation risk assessment tool that balances static factors with dynamic factors and has capacity to identify need patterns and profiles of offender groups . It is \u2018 regarded as a good predictor of general reoffending , but also a modest predictor of violence . Its capacity to predict sexual reoffending is mixed \u2019 ( State of New South Wales v Graham James Kay [ 2018 ] NSWSC 1235 , Wilson J at [ 39 ] ) . Such judicial commentary provides insights into the limitations of such risk assessment tools . Indeed , the LSI-R instrument has been criticised for being framed by specific geographic and temporal inputs ( Koepke and Robinson 2018 ) and on the basis that offenders do not have homogenous criminogenic needs or profiles ( Hsu et al . 2009 ) . Clearly much reliance is being placed on actuarial predictive tools in the risk assessment of offenders at many levels of the criminal justice system ( Carlson 2017 ) and multiple forms of scoring risk are evident in the case law . Nevertheless there are recognised shortcomings . The assessing psychologist in State of NSW v Dillon ( Final ) recognised the limitations of the STATIC-99R or STATIC-2002R instruments being that the recidivism estimates and rankings are based on groups of individuals , not necessarily directly reflective of the particular offender . He told the court : When comparing group data to individual cases it is important to note that factors and circumstances unique to an individual may not have been captured within the normative group and caution must be exercised when making such a comparison . ( State of New South Wales v Dillon ( Final ) [ 2018 ] NSWSC 1626 , at [ 102 ] ) . Moreover , the assessing psychologist explained that the tool may predict forms of sexual reoffending that would not actually even fall within the ambit of \u2018 serious \u2019 sexual offences . Such actuarial instruments produce scores that \u2018 do not differentiate between the severity of offences that might be committed \u2019 , for example , they do not distinguish between grievous bodily harm and assault occasioning actual bodily harm ( State of New South Wales v King ( Final ) [ 2019 ] NSWSC 151 , at [ 142 ] ) . STATIC instruments are also not sensitive to any changing circumstances that may positively or negatively affect the offender \u2019 s actual risks of reoffending ( State of New South Wales v"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cook ( Final ) [ 2019 ] NSWSC 51 ) . Nevertheless , findings from tools such as the STATIC-99R are often combined with other tools such as the STABLE-2007 to present a composite Risks-Needs-Responsivity ( RNR ) assessment that focuses on risk management in the structuring of interventions , treatment and support ( Smid 2014 ; Eckhouse et al . 2019 ; Moore 2015 ) . The statistical likelihood of reoffending may also scored through other instruments including the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide \u2013 Revised ( VRAG-R ) and the Violence Risk Scale ( Grann and L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m 2007 ) . On the face of it , it seems that these actuarial or algorithmic instruments offer evidence-based and objective forms of risk assessment . However , a number of critical concerns have been expressed . Jones and Milton ( 2016 : 1 ) note the advantages of statistical methods especially in dealing with large caseloads but importantly acknowledge that algorithms provide \u2018 very little information about the actual individual being assessed \u2019 thus recognising the conflict with the principle of individualised justice . Other studies have found that the margins of error of these actuarial or mathematical methods are large and the application of group data to an individual can not be meaningfully undertaken with precision ( Hart et al . 2007 ) . Several scholars identify the opacity of the algorithm as being particularly problematic , that is , the actual algorithm , its inputs or processes may be protected trade secrets so that individuals impacted by the algorithmic assessment can not critique or understand the determination ( Hogan-Doran 2017 ; Carlson 2017 ) . For example , is it possible to question the exact weighting applied to various risk factors to understand if the weighting is excessive or disproportionate to other factors ? How can individuals respond to the case brought against them , challenge the accuracy of the algorithm and defend themselves against an adverse determination ? At the end of the day , are there decisions or assessments that critically impact individual human lives and liberty that should not be delegated to algorithms ? Automated systems and algorithmic assessments have become \u2018 a largely uncontested aspect \u2019 and de rigeur in criminal procedure ( Carlson 2017 : 313 quoting Harcourt 2005 ) yet they give rise to questions as to exactly who - or what - is now the primary decision-maker ( Hogan- Doran 2017 ) . Algorithms and Embedded Bias The US case of State of Wisconsin v Loomis 881 N.W.2d 749 ( Wis. 2016 ) illustrates the challenges in utilising algorithmic risk assessment tools , such as the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions ( COMPAS ) , in sentencing procedure ( Gordon 2017 : Harvard 2017 ) . COMPAS , designed by Northpointe ( now Equivant ) , a private for-profit company , is used to assess an offender \u2019 s criminogenic needs and predict the likelihood of their reoffending ( Eckhouse"}]}

It is used widely in the US by various justice agencies \u2018 to inform decisions regarding the placement , supervision and case management of offenders \u2019 ( Northpointe 2012 ) . Pre-sentencing , Mr Loomis was assessed by COMPAS as presenting a high risk of reoffending and ultimately sentenced to six years imprisonment and five years of extended supervision . He appealed against the severity of the sentence and asserted that the COMPAS tool breached his right to be sentenced according to accurate information , it breached his right to an individualised sentence , and it improperly used gendered assessments ( Carlson 2017 ) . On appeal , the Supreme Court held that the defendant \u2019 s right to due process was not violated by the use of a risk assessment scoring system . Loomis raises the issues of profiling an individual against a predictive algorithm and concerns regarding the biases embedded within . There is unease that algorithmic tools may disproportionately score some offenders , particularly from marginalised communities , as having a higher risk of reoffending , reinforcing dominant social hegemonies , prejudice and inequality ( Martin 2017 ; Angwin et al . 2016 ) . Broad ( 2018 ) examines how the over-policing of black populations in the US fashions the algorithms used in criminal justice . Eckhouse et al . ( 2019 ) examine the layers of embedded bias in statistical risk assessments \u2013 how the process of using data from an already racially biased criminal justice system perpetuates bias in the resultant risk scores . In relation to the COMPAS tool used in Loomis , that instrument was found by ProPublica to be \u2018 nearly twice as likely to inaccurately predict that a Black defendant was at high risk for rearrest as a White defendant \u2019 ( Eckhouse et al . 2019 : 190 quoting Angwin et al . 2016 ) , that is , it can falsely label and misclassify Black defendants as criminals ( Carlson 2017 ) . These conclusions have been disputed ( Northpointe 2016 ; ProPublica 2016 ; Tashea 2017 ) . Moreover in Loomis , the risk factor in question was gender , not race , and it was argued , unsuccessfully , that due process was violated by the use of a risk assessment tool in which gender was a factor . Ultimately , the use of COMPAS in Loomis was seen as acceptable given that it was not the sole determinative means to assess the risk of reoffending . However , the judgment did acknowledge the dangers in placing complete reliance on algorithmic instruments in decisions concerning liberty ( Eckhouse et al . 2019 ) . Algorithms as Proprietary Products Loomis also reveals the impenetrability of algorithms that are subject to proprietary interests or trade secrets ( Gordon 2017 ) . While the offender in Loomis could verify certain inputs to the risk assessment , the concluding score that"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "recommended a significant prison sentence could not be challenged as the internal structure and formulae of the COMPAS algorithm was based on proprietary information . The Court accepted that Northpointe treated COMPAS as a trade secret and therefore it did not need to disclose how risk scores or factors were determined and weighed ( Carlson 2017 ) . Therefore Mr Loomis was not entitled to access the formulae or factors that were determinative in his high risk score and his significant punishment . As the Honourable Justice Martin argues , \u2018 this is entirely inconsistent with the common law requirement that a decision maker must expose his or her reasoning \u2019 ( Martin 2017 : 22 ) . Profiling an individual \u2019 s behaviour and characteristics against meta-data is also problematic as the process is largely invisible and its validity is difficult to challenge . Risk assessment tools are constantly evolving and must be monitored and \u2018 re-normed for accuracy due to changing populations and subpopulations \u2019 ( Loomis : 769 ) . According to Hogan-Doran ( 2017 : 13 quoting Goodfellow et al . 2017 ) , the internal structure of algorithms , especially those based on Deep Learning , are virtually impossible to decipher given the cascade of layers of processing units . This leads to the \u2018 black box \u2019 problem where the inputs and outputs may be clear but the process remains opaque . Eckhouse et al . ( 2019 : 16 ) critique the Loomis decision as failing to address the trade secret of the COMPAS instrument , thereby preventing \u2018 judges , defendants , and researchers from vetting the algorithms and evaluating the fairness \u2019 . Carlson ( 2017 : 329 ) argues that the use of risk assessment tools such as COMPAS in criminal justice should be subject to the \u2018 same transparency requirements as other government agencies \u2019 instead of protecting the commercial interests of the private vendor . Interestingly , the Supreme Court in Loomis held that future risk assessments using COMPAS must disclose the proprietary nature of the instrument and how its scores are based on group data from a national sample , rather than the particular individual . Whether that warning will successfully encourage a degree of scepticism in judges regarding the use of risk assessment instruments is debatable , given the broad endorsement of these tools throughout the criminal justice system and the efficiency pressures placed on the judiciary ( Harvard 2017 ) . Clearly the algorithmic instruments used to predict risks of reoffending are largely sealed , secret and autonomous . In this way , it is argued that the proprietorial nature of algorithms created by private organisations challenges the fundamental principles of procedural justice , particularly , open justice and individualised justice . Technologised Procedural Justice As a range of technologies intrude and transform legal procedure and practice , there is an imperative to scrutinise the ethics of using algorithmic tools in the context of the"}]}

Is it possible to reconcile new technologies with traditional common law principles , professional ethics and human rights ( Martin 2017 ; AHRC 2018 ; Law Society 2019 ) ? When risk assessment tools are analysed through the lens of procedural justice principles , it quickly becomes evident how algorithmic instruments and automated systems that make decisions about people \u2019 s lives and liberty may compromise procedural justice . Procedural justice , a slippery term that encapsulates fairness and due process , derives from natural justice and its elements include open justice , equality before the law , the presumption of innocence and the right to hear and answer a case brought by the state ( McKay 2018 ; Bronitt and McSherry 2017 ; Mulcahy 2013 ) . According to open justice , criminal proceedings should be subject to public oversight as a means to counteract abuses of power and to promote transparency , accountability and ultimately , the rule of law ( Resnik 2015 ) . Open justice may be undermined when defendants , courts and society are denied the oversight of algorithmic tools that are used in determining a defendant \u2019 s legal status and liberty . Such tools need to be \u2018 testable and contestable \u2019 ( Hildebrandt 2018 : 34 ) . Equality of arms is a key principle in procedural justice meaning that the defendant should not be at a disadvantage compared with the prosecuting state , that is , there should be a level playing field ( Roberts and Zuckerman 2010 ) . Of course , in criminal procedure , that principle represents the ideal rather than the reality , nevertheless it is further challenged in situations where the prosecution uses inscrutable algorithmic tools and undisclosed input data against a defendant . The presumption of innocence is the golden thread that runs through the criminal justice system to ensure that the legal onus of proof remains on the prosecution ( Woolmington v DPP [ 1935 ] AC 462 ) . If there is no way of proving or disproving an algorithm \u2019 s formulae or methodology , the burden of proving a case against a defendant beyond reasonable doubt seems compromised . Additionally , both the presumption of innocence as well as the principle of individualised justice ( Martin 2017 ) are potentially undermined when an individual defendant is assessed against aggregate group data . Finally , the hearing rule , audi alteram partem , requires that the defendant be enabled to hear and comprehend the case being brought against them ( Butt and Hamer 2011 ) yet the use of secret proprietary information against a citizen is at odds with this right . These issues can also be assessed through the lens of human rights principles ( AHRC 2018 ; Pasquale and Cashwell 2018 ; Aletras et al . 2006 ; ICCPR ) . For instance , there is the potential for algorithmic instruments to violate human"}]}

Other human rights measures that may be challenged by AI include the presumption of innocence , general procedural fairness requirements including the presentation of an understandable case against the defendant , and protection from discrimination . A report in England and Wales highlights these challenges to procedural justice as well as embedded bias , lack of scrutiny and the disregard of individual contextual factors ( Law Society 2019 ) . Rather than as an after- thought , procedural safeguards therefore need to be considered before the cautious implementation of algorithmic assessments that \u2018 score \u2019 a person and determine their liberty or legal status . Procedural justice demands that persons affected by an algorithmic determination should be enabled to unpack and contest the decision ( Keats Citron and Pasquale 2014 ) . The suppression of algorithms \u2019 operation and structure means that courts , judiciary , legal profession and defendants are denied the ability to comprehend and contest the decision-making process . Legitimacy and the Rule of Law The diminution of procedural justice values can be seen as ultimately undermining the legitimacy of criminal process . A 2019 Australian Discussion Paper identified a range of core AI principles including \u2018 Generates net-benefits \u2019 , \u2018 Do no harm \u2019 , \u2018 Regulatory and legal compliance \u2019 , \u2018 Privacy protection \u2019 , \u2018 Fairness \u2019 , \u2018 Transparency & Explainability \u2019 , \u2018 Contestability \u2019 and \u2018 Accountability \u2019 ( Dawson et al . 2019 : 6 ) . What is missing is the principle of legitimacy that underpins society \u2019 s voluntary compliance and trust in the law . Legitimacy is premised on a \u2018 moral authority , which in turn depends on law \u2019 s ability to justify its requirements \u2019 ( Stern 2018 : 4 quoting Sheppard 2018 and Raz 1979 ; McKay 2019 ) . It is associated with the rule of law that , amongst other things , requires legal decision-makers to have authority to determine outcomes and for the decision- making process to be examinable and contestable ( Oswald 2018 ) . In addition , the rule of law provides for legal certainty , as well as checks and balances that enable citizens to enforce fundamental rights ( Hildebrandt 2018 ) . To fulfil legitimacy , the law must be \u2018 accessible and so far as possible intelligible , clear and predictable \u2019 ( Gordon 2017 : 2 quoting Lord Bingham 2006 ) . However , it is clear that when responsibility for a decision is delegated to an algorithmic instrument , that delegation can render decision- making opaque , inscrutable and incontestable ( Hildebrandt 2018 ) . On this basis , this article has sought to demonstrate some of the ways that the legitimacy of criminal procedure is challenged when decision-making authority is \u2018 ceded to"}]}

Impacts of Risk Scores on Decision-makers Can the mere existence of a risk assessment score , even as complementary methodology , sway a human decision-maker ? Eckhouse et al . ( 2019 ) suggest yes ; a predictive risk score can influence a judge \u2019 s decision by focusing attention on potential recidivism over and above other relevant factors . For example , Carlson ( 2017 ) discusses a case where the COMPAS score was so high that the sentencing judge overturned the plea deal and sentenced the offender to two years , whereas the judge acknowledged that without the risk assessment , he would have only imposed a one year sentence . In addition , risk-adverse judges may rely on risk scores as a means to deflect blame onto the algorithm , in effect the risk assessment tool acts to \u2018 de-reponsibilize decision- makers \u2019 ( Harcourt 2010 ) ; Carlson 2017 ; Eckhouse et al . 2019 ) . Other studies suggest that it would be unusual for a judge to defy the algorithmic conclusion ( Harvard 2017 ; Christin et al . 2015 ) . Indeed , given the proprietorial claims made by vendors of algorithmic tools , it would be impossible for a judge to meaningfully critique or challenge the risk assessment . Ultimately , judges can be \u2018 questioned and rebuked for discriminatory behaviour \u2019 ( Pasquale and Cashwell 2018 : 66 ) \u2018 whereas an algorithm subtly premised on biased data \u2026 could remain virtually immune from criticism \u2019 ( Stern 2018 : 6 ) . While earlier in this article I discussed criticisms of judicial decision-makers and their perceived human \u2018 subconscious bias \u2019 ( Stobbs et al . 2017 : 262 ) , embedding algorithmic unconscious processes into decision-making does not address transparency concerns ; it serves only to replace human intuition with mechanical inscrutability and incontestability ( Oswald 2018 ; Hildebrandt 2018 ; Stern 2018 ) . Conclusion With the potential for algorithmic instruments to \u2018 deeply change the nature of the evolution of the law \u2019 ( Law Society 2019 : 4 ) , there is a recognised need for responsible , accountable and ethical algorithmic design ( Kroll 2015 ) and suggestions that , instead of placing reliance on the private commercial sector , governments ought to develop their own actuarial and algorithmic instruments ( Carlson 2017 ) . But in countries such as Australia , where the separation of powers between executive and judicial functions is valued , that could lead to an unacceptable blurring of that separation . Certainly , various scholars support the idea of a regulatory body to oversee and audit algorithms and thereby ensure transparency , accountability and procedural justice ( Hogan-Doran 2017 ; Pasquale 2017 ; Balkin 2017 ) . For example in England and Wales , a National Register of Algorithmic Systems has been recommended ( Law Society 2019 ) . Various"}]}

Criminal justice is a human institution \u2013 it is focused on human behaviours and human harms and has , traditionally , resolved human transgression in a communal fashion . While traditional , non-technologised procedure can not be valourised , the legitimacy of the criminal justice system , and particularly the coercive power of the state to punish , imprison and supervise offenders , has been premised on open justice , a system that aspires to accountability , impartiality and transparency . The incursion of secret algorithms devised by the private for-profit sector into the public duties of judicial officers challenges the presumed independence of judicial functions . While algorithmic instruments may be useful and complementary predictive tools , they have no role as a sole or final arbiter . To invoke proprietorial protections and financial interests is to prohibit defendants , courts and the community from scrutinising the validity and reliability of predictive formulae used in deterministic criminal procedures . The situation thus synthesizes an element into decision-making that is even more opaque than any exercise of judicial discretion . At least an imperfect decision by a judge may be tested on appeal , whereas an imperfect algorithm may be forever concealed .

By September 2024 , the number of approved loan applications had reached 269 , reflecting a staggering 79.77 % increase compared to the previous year.1 However , the rise of these digital lending platforms has brought with it an unsettling trend : the public shaming of borrowers . Many loan apps , in their quest for repayment , have resorted to unethical tactics , including sending defamatory and intrusive messages to debtors \u2019 contacts or as we saw in the first week of the year , posting the pictures of the debtors on social media . These actions , while effective in some cases , raise critical questions about the balance between debt recovery and the right to privacy . With data protection laws like Nigeria \u2019 s NDPA and global standards such as the GDPR , the boundaries of lawful debt collection are becoming increasingly scrutinized . This article explores the legal boundaries surrounding the publicity of loan collection actions by these companies , focusing on the operation of consumer finance companies , legal boundaries of publicity in loan collections and the effect of breach . Operation of Consumer Finance Companies in Nigeria In Nigeria , various finance companies operate across a wide range of services , including asset financing , investment advisory , and personal loans . However , the focus of this article is on the digital consumer finance companies which offer short-term loans to individuals via mobile applications . A digital consumer finance company engages in providing personal loans to individuals . A characteristic feature of these companies is that the loans they offer are usually unsecured . In other words , borrowers are not required to provide collateral to appetite/ accessed 15th of January 2025. secure the loan , which often introduces a higher risk for the lenders . This unsecured nature of the loans often leads to higher interest rates charged to borrowers . Another notable characteristic of these companies is their primary target demographic : the underbanked or unbanked population , which makes it easier for individuals to access loans through their mobile applications without the need for traditional banking infrastructure . An article from the Consumer Protection Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN ) outlines the consequences of defaulting on loans , which include the loss of collateral , poor credit ratings , legal prosecution , and potential damage to business operations.2 In recent times , however , many digital lenders have resorted to increasingly aggressive debt recovery tactics , including constant insults and public humiliation of defaulters , which has raised significant concerns regarding the ethical and legal implications of such practices.3 This practice , often referred to as `` naming and shaming , '' may violate both the privacy rights of debtors and the"}]}

Legal Boundaries of Publicity in Loan Collection The practice of publicly shaming debtors during the loan recovery process in Nigeria has sparked considerable debate . While there is no specific legislation that directly addresses the act of publicly humiliating borrowers , several existing laws and regulations indirectly govern the manner in which debt recovery should be conducted . Public humiliation , as a tactic in debt recovery , is generally deemed unethical and is prohibited under several consumer protection laws in Nigeria . These include : 1 . The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria ( 1999 ) : As the supreme law of the land , the Nigerian Constitution guarantees the protection of individuals ' 2 accessed 14 January 2025 customers-to-recover-funds/ accessed 13 January 2025 fundamental rights . Specifically , Section 34 of the Constitution4 protects citizens from inhuman and degrading treatment . Public humiliation of borrowers , in the context of debt recovery , is a degrading treatment to defaulters . The Constitution safeguards the dignity of every individual , and any law or practice that contradicts this provision would be considered unconstitutional . Therefore , any financial institution that engages in public humiliation as a means of recovering debt is in violation of the constitutional right of the debtor . 2 . The Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN ) Consumer Protection Regulations , 2019 : The CBN has established clear guidelines to ensure ethical lending practices . Under Article 3.2.1 of the Regulation,5 financial institutions are required to treat their customers with respect , courtesy , and fairness . Practices such as threats , intimidation , humiliation , and unfair inducements are explicitly prohibited . Additionally , Article 3.3.1 of the Regulation,6 particularly paragraph ( h ) , states that any terms in contracts that purport to waive consumer protections provided by applicable laws , regulations , or guidelines are void and unenforceable . These regulations reinforce the need for financial institutions to adhere to ethical standards and reject any practices that infringe upon the rights and dignity of their customers . 3 . The Nigeria Data Protection Act ( NDPA ) , 2023 : The NDPA regulates the collection , processing , and sharing of personal data in Nigeria , including data related to loan defaulters . Section 25 ( 1 ) of the NDPA specifies the conditions under which personal data processing is lawful . Subsection 27 highlights two ( 2 ) critical circumstances under which data processing becomes unlawful : 4 The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria , 1999 5 The Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN ) Consumer Protection Regulations , 2019 6 Ibid . 7 The Nigeria Data Protection Act ( NDPA ) , 2023 a ) When it overrides the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject , including the right to privacy . b ) When the data subject does not reasonably expect their personal information to be processed"}]}

As such , the use of personal data to publicly shame debtors\u2014especially if it involves disclosing sensitive financial information or details about the individual \u2019 s repayment history\u2014would likely contravene the provisions of the NDPA , exposing the offending companies to potential legal sanctions . Effect of Breach of the Laws Failure to comply with these legal frameworks can have significant consequences for consumer finance companies . Violations of constitutional rights , consumer protection regulations , or data protection laws could lead to legal action from both regulatory bodies and individual consumers . Potential consequences include : 1 . Legal liabilities and penalties : Flagrant breach of the laws may result in penalties and sanctions from the regulatory bodies . For instance , Article 7 of the Regulation8 outlines the penalties for violation of the guidelines which includes monetary sanctions and administrative sanctions of the institutions . In the same vein , Section 46 of the NDPA9 allows the Nigerian Data Privacy Commission ( NDPC ) to investigate allegations of data breaches and sanction the institution where necessary . 2 . Civil suit : Consumers whose rights are violated may seek redress through the courts as this is supported by various laws specifically Section 46 of the Nigerian 8 The Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN ) Consumer Protection Regulations , 2019 . 9 The Nigeria Data Protection Act ( NDPA ) , 2023 Constitution.10 This suit may lead to lengthy legal proceedings and potential compensation for damages caused as a result of reputational damage . The recourse to civil suits is also supported by the provision of Section 51 of the NDPA.11 3 . Reputational Damage : Publicly humiliating debtors or mishandling personal data can severely damage a company 's reputation . This , in turn , can lead to a loss of consumer trust and reduced business patronage . Alternatives to Public Shaming for the Recovery of Loans in Nigeria While the practice of public humiliation is legally questionable , financial institutions can adopt more ethical and legally compliant methods for debt recovery . The lender may first resort to negotiation and mediation as the first attempt to reach a mutually agreeable repayment plan with the borrower , rather than resorting to punitive measures . If this fails , the lenders may seek redress through the legal system by pursuing a civil suit for recovery of the debt , in accordance with established laws . Where the lender requires an alternative , he may engage debt recovery agencies to recover the debt . If the finance companies adopt either of these fair and transparent debt recovery practices , they can minimize the risk of violating debtors ' rights while still ensuring they recover owed funds .

Murphy * I Introduction In courtrooms across the world , criminal cases are no longer proved only through traditional means such as eyewitnesses , confessions , or rudimen- tary physical evidence like the proverbial smoking gun . Instead , prosecu- tors increasingly harness technologies , including those developed and used for purposes other than law enforcement , to generate criminal evidence.1 This kind of digital data may take different forms , including raw data , data that is produced by a machine without any processing ; measurement data , data that is produced by a machine after rudimentary calculations ; and evaluative data , data that is produced by a machine according to sophisticated algorithmic methods that can not be reproduced manually.2 These distinctions are likewise evident in the array of consumer products that can now be tapped to produce evidence in a criminal case . A mobile phone can be used to track the user \u2019 s location via raw data in the form of a readout of which tower the cell phone \u201c pinged , \u201d via measurement data reflecting the triangulation of data towers accessed along a person \u2019 s route , or with evaluative data generated by a machine-learning algorithm to pre- dict the precise location of a person , such as a specific shop in a shopping mall.3 In all three forms , the use of such data presents new evidentiary challenges , although it is the evaluative data that raises the most issues as a result of both its precision and impenetrability . * I am deeply grateful to Safeena Mecklai for her outstanding research assistance . 1 See e.g .

In a world increasingly reliant on technological forms of proof , the failure to afford full pre-trial rights of discovery and inves- tigation to the defense fatally undermines the presumption of innocence and the basic precepts of due process . Persons accused of crimes have two compelling needs with regard to digital evidence . First , criminal defendants must be granted the power to meaningfully attack the government \u2019 s digital proof , whether offered by the government to prove its affirmative case or to counter evidence tendered by the defense.4 For example , the defense might challenge cell site location records that purport to show the defendant \u2019 s location at the scene of the crime . Or they might contest cell site records offered by the government to undermine a defense witness \u2019 s claim to have witnessed the incident . The defendant is attacking the government \u2019 s proffered digital evidence in both cases , but in the first variation , the attack responds to the government \u2019 s evidence in its case-in-chief , whereas the second variation responds to evi- dence proffered by the government to counter a defense claim or witness . The defense \u2019 s use of digital evidence in this way differs from the second category , which might be called supportive defense evidence . A defen- dant must be able to access and introduce the defendant \u2019 s own digital proof , in order to support a defense theory or to attack the government \u2019 s non-digital evidence . For example , the defendant might use digital data to show that the defendant is innocent , to reinforce testimony offered by a defense witness , or to support a claim that another person in fact committed the offense . Classic examples of such use would be DNA evi- dence that proves there was another perpetrator , or surveillance footage that reveals the perpetrator had a distinguishing mark not shared by the defendant . A defendant might also use such evidence to bolster a legal claim . In the United States , e.g. , the defendant might use digital proof to argue that evidence must be suppressed because it was obtained in vio- lation of the Constitution.5 Or a defendant might use digital evidence to 4 See Chapter 7 in this volume ( recognizing five key rights of the accused ) . 5 United States v.

What links these examples of supportive defense evidence is that the defense introduces digital proof of its own ; it does not just attack the digi- tal proof offered by the government . In both cases \u2013 when the defense aims to attack government digital proof , or when it aims to introduce its own digital proof \u2013 the defendant can not effectively mount a defense without access to and the ability to challenge complex forms of digital proof . Yet , in all too many jurisdictions , the legal system has embraced the government \u2019 s use of technological tools to inculpate a defendant6 without reckoning with the equivalent needs of the accused.7 Baseline principles such as those enshrined in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the US Constitution and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights sketch broad rights , but how those rights are actually implemented , and the governing rules and statutes that embody those values , may vary dramatically.8 In the United States , crim- inal defendants have few positive investigatory powers,9 and are largely dependent on rules that mandate government disclosure of limited forms of evidence or the backstop of the constitutional rights of due process , confrontation , and compulsory process.10 6 The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Reynolds School of Journalism created a data- base of police surveillance technologies , which is a helpful compilation of some police sur- veillance practices .

Criminal defendants must typically rely on either a court order or subpoena to obtain information from third parties , but both of those mechanisms are typically understood as intended for the purpose of presenting evidence at trial , not conducting pre-trial investigation.11 And even sympathetic courts struggle to determine whether and how much to grant requests .

Section II iden- tifies and provides examples for seven categories of such data : loca- tion trackers , electronic communications and social media , historical search or cloud or vendor records , the \u201c Internet of Things \u201d and smart tools , surveillance cameras , biometric identifiers , and analytical soft- ware tools . Although the examples in this chapter are drawn primarily from legal cases in the United States , these technologies are currently in broad use around the world . Section III then considers ten sepa- rate characteristics that attend these technologies , and how each may affect the analysis of the proper scope of defense access . Section IV concludes . II A Taxonomy of Digital Proof The first step in articulating the issues that confound defense access to digital proof is to outline the general categories into which such technol- ogies fall . Of course , digital information is used throughout the criminal justice process , e.g. , in pre-trial bail and detention risk assessments and post-conviction at the time of sentencing . This chapter , however , focuses only on the use of such digital evidence to investigate and prove or dis- prove a defendant \u2019 s guilt . In addition , although it might at first glimpse be appealing to attempt to draw sharp distinctions between consumer products and forensic law enforcement technologies , those categories prove illu- sory in this context.15 The line between consumer and law enforce- ment either collapses , or is simply arbitrarily drawn , when it comes to defense investigation . For example , what difference does it make if law enforcement uses surveillance video from a police camera versus security footage from a Ring doorbell-camera or private bank ? What does it matter if the facial recognition software is used on a repository of high school yearbooks versus police mugshots ? Are questions of access so different when DNA testing was done via a public lab versus by a private lab , or whether the search was in a commercial versus law enforcement database ? Even if such a line were drawn ,"}]}

Is that a consumer product or law enforcement tool ? Or if law enforcement secretly signs an agreement with a consumer DNA database to enable testing and searches for police purposes , is that a consumer tool or law enforcement tool ? All too often , the lines between the two will break down as increasingly public\u2013private cooperation generates evidence pertinent for a criminal case . Of course , concerns about the reliability of evidence may differ when the evidence derives from a consumer product used by the general public as opposed to a forensic tool used only by law enforcement . Regulatory regimes and market incentives exercise an oversight function for com- mercial applications , and the financial incentives that ensure reliability for commercial products may be lacking in the law enforcement con- text . But those safeguards are not a substitute for a defendant \u2019 s opportu- nity to access and challenge technological evidence , because reliability of the government \u2019 s proof is not the only value at stake . The defense must have a meaningful right to access or challenge technological evidence , as a means of testing the non-digital aspects of the government \u2019 s proof as well as bolster its own case . Thus , in taxonomizing digital evidence , this chapter acknowledges but does not differentiate between technology created and used by general consumers versus those created primarily or exclusively by police . II.A Location Data The general label \u201c location data \u201d covers a wide array of technological tools that help establish the presence or absence of a person in a particular place and , often , time . Location evidence may derive from mobile phone car- riers that either directly track GPS location or indirectly provide cell-site location services , license plate scanning technology , electronic toll pay- ment systems , or even \u201c smart \u201d cars or utility meters that can indicate the presence or absence of persons or the number of persons in a particular space at a particular time . The use of such technologies to implicate a defendant is obvious . Evidence that a defendant was in a particular location at a particular time may prove that a defendant had access to a particular place , support an inference that the defendant committed an act , or reinforce a witness \u2019 s assertions . For example"}]}

A law enforcement officer or witness may be shown to have arrived at the scene after a pivotal moment , or left prior to a critical development . An alleged third-party perpetrator may be proved to have accessed a controlled site , or to have interacted with culpable associates . The inability of defendants to access such information directly often leaves them reliant upon either the thoroughness of government investigators or the willingness of a court to authorize subpoenas for such information . For example , one police report described cases in which police used license-plate- reading cameras to support each defendant \u2019 s claim of innocence , and thus to exonerate individuals from false accusations.17 But such open-minded and thorough investigation is not always the norm . In some cases , the govern- ment may have little incentive to seek information that contradicts the gov- ernment \u2019 s theory or calls into question the government \u2019 s proof . In Quinones v. United States,18 the defendant alleged that his coun- sel was ineffective for failing to seek location data including both GPS and license plate readings that the defendant argued would support his claim that he had not been residing for months in the location where fire- arms were found , but rather had only recently visited . The court rejected the claim , stating that the defendant \u201c fails to provide any indication that such evidence even exists , and if so , what that evidence would have revealed , \u201d and that \u201c [ a ] license plate reader would merely indicate that a certain vehicle was at a certain location at a specific time , but such would not conclusively prove the location of an individual. \u201d 19 Another court 16 Kathleen McWilliams , \u201c New Haven Man Jailed for 17 Years Freed after Judge Vacates Murder , Robbery Convictions , \u201d Hartford Courant ( April 25 , 2018 ) , www.courant.com/ breaking-news/hc-br-vernon-horn-released-wrongful-conviction-20180425-story.html . 17 Press Release , \u201c Grosse Ile Police Department Exonerates Two Individuals Using Fixed License Plate Reader Cameras , \u201d Vigilant Solutions ( February 4 , 2016 ) ,"}]}

Wells . In that case , the court dis- missed the significance of automatic toll records , noting that \u201c [ t ] here was no individual camera for the FasTrak lane . These inherent limitations in the underlying videotape evidence made it possible for defendant \u2019 s car to pass through undetected \u2026. \u201d 21 But of course , the very point of investigation is to find information that is not already known , including information that impeaches or con- tradicts critical witnesses , and to present such evidence , even though it may be equivocal . As one law firm wrote in a post that underscored the importance of location records , obtaining the complainant \u2019 s location data aided the firm in convincing the government that the complaint was unfounded.22 The point of these cases is not so much that such evidence is always decisive . Rather , they highlight the discrepancy between the ease , even if not unfettered,23 with which courts recognize that access to and intro- duction of such evidence is critical to building a government case , while dismissing its importance in mounting a defense .

As one leading treatise puts it : \u201c E-mail is inordinately susceptible to revealing \u2018 smoking gun \u2019 evidence. \u201d 25 Email and text messages com- prise a significant fraction of digital records of communication , but social media accounts on platforms such as Facebook , Snapchat , Instagram , and X ( formerly known as Twitter ) also provide fertile ground for data.26 Although criminal defendants typically have access to their own records , historical information including deleted material or material generated by other persons may not be as readily obtainable . In one high-profile case in England , a man spent three years in prison in connection with a rape allegation . He contended the encounter was innocent , but it was only when his family was able to locate an original thread of Facebook messages by the complainant that it was revealed that she had altered the thread to make the incident appear non- consensual.27 In a similar case in the United States , the court dismissed as critical to an effective defense the effort to obtain Facebook evidence.28 24 \u201c Danish Data Retention : Back to Normal after Major Crisis , \u201d EDRi ( November 6 , 2019 ) , see also Lene"}]}

In one especially prominent case , James Bates was charged with stran- gling and drowning a man , based in part on evidence from Amazon Echo and a smart water meter . The water evidence presumably showed a five-fold uptake in usage that police said corresponding to spraying down the crime scene.47 But after reviewing the Amazon Echo evidence , prosecutors dropped the case , noting that they could not definitively prove that the accused had committed the murder.48 In Bates \u2019 case , it was not clear that either the government or the defense could eas- ily access the evidence , as Amazon initially refused its release to either party , but relented when Bates agreed to allow government access .

For good or bad reasons , law enforcement may act as gatekeepers of the data , but when they deny defense requests in order to protect privacy interests , they privilege their own assessment of the relevance of such data or simply act in self- interest to safeguard their case from attack . In an example from New York , a defense attorney subpoenaed surveil- lance footage held by the New York Police Department to corroborate the accused \u2019 s exculpatory account . The prosecutor reluctantly disclosed a portion of the video , claiming that it was only required to disclose video as required by its statutory discovery obligations and the Brady rule,57 but the defendant asserted an \u201c independent right to subpoena video that will exonerate her. \u201d 58 The court , reviewing the arguments , stated:59 [ S ] ince the inception of this case , the defense forcefully and persistently attempted to obtain surveillance footage that had the potential to \u201c under- cut \u201d the complainant \u2019 s claims and to corroborate his client \u2019 s claim that she was not present at nor involved in any criminal activity \u2026 The defense , however , in contrast to Cruz , could not simply subpoena this potentially exculpating evidence because the footage was held by the NYPD \u2026 . Here , the defense compellingly argued that if immediate action was not taken , the recordings , which are maintained by the NYPD \u2019 s VIPER Unit for a period of no more than 30 days , would be destroyed . Ultimately ruling on various motions in the case , the court held that the US Constitution and state laws supported the court \u2019 s preservation order , even if the state \u2019 s discovery rules did not.60 But the closeness of the fight demonstrates the extent to which the defense must overcome signif- icant hurdles to access basic information . 57 Brady v.

Biometrics include famil- iar techniques such as fingerprinting and blood typing , but also more sophisticated or emerging methods like probabilistic DNA analysis that relies on algorithms to make \u201c matches , \u201d iris scanning , facial recognition technologies , or gait or speech analysis . This category of digital proof may be the most familiar in terms of its exonerative use and thus perhaps requires the least illustration . The Innocence Project sparked a global movement to use DNA testing to free wrongfully convicted persons.61 But biometric identifiers might also be used by the defense more generally , such as to identify eyewitnesses or alternate suspects , or to bolster the defense . In a disputed incident , biometric evi- dence might support the defense version , e.g. , DNA on the couch but not the bed , over that of the prosecution . Because of the particular power of DNA , there have been extensive legal analysis of the myriad legal hurdles for the defense in preserving , obtaining , and testing physical evidence,62 including the fact that phys- ical evidence is typically in the hands of the government , and the tools and expertise required to analyze it may exceed the reach of even well- resourced defense counsel . II.G Analytical Software Tools The final category of digital proof overlaps in many ways with the pre- ceding groups , and focuses primarily on the evaluative data generated by machines . The label \u201c analytical software tools \u201d generally describes com- puter software that is used to reach conclusions or conduct analyses that mimic or exceed the scope of human cognition . By way of example , prosecutors often rely on artificial intelligence ( AI ) and machine learning to identify complex patterns or process incomplete data . Perhaps the most common form of such evidence is found in the \u201c probabilistic genotyping systems \u201d used by the government to untangle difficult or degraded DNA samples .

Defense teams have often sought access to the algorithms underlying probabilistic genotyping software that returns inculpatory results used by the prosecution . But companies typically refuse full access , raising trade secret claims that are accepted uncritically by courts.63 Such software might also be sought by the defense for directly exculpatory reasons , not just to call into question the accuracy of the government \u2019 s approach,64 but also to demonstrate that a different party perpetrated the offense or that another interpretation of the evidence is possible.65 DNA profiles are not the only targets for analytical software . Evidence from facial recognition software can cast new light on grainy surveillance video,66 or a speech pattern analysis . As one commentator explains:67 \u2026 in a blurry surveillance video or an unclear audio recording , the naked eye and ear may be insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , but certain recognition algorithms could do so easily . Lip-reading algo- rithms might tell jurors what was said on video where there is no audio available . A machine might construct an estimation of a perpetrator \u2019 s face from only a DNA sample , or in other DNA analysis of corrupted samples . Of course , the same could be true for the defense . Software could cor- roborate a defense claim or undermine the credibility of a government witness . It could also aid the defense in identifying other witnesses to the event or alternative perpetrators . In a case where inculpatory evi- dence was seized from a computer , the defense successfully argued for suppression of the evidence by obtaining information about how the software used to search the computer worked , thereby showing the search exceeded its permissible scope.68 63 See e.g . \u201c Life , Liberty \u201d and \u201c Trial by Machine \u201d , both note 7 above . 64 See e.g .

And as the preceding section demonstrates , it is not the case that the data \u2019 s reliability is a defen- dant \u2019 s only concern . The defense also requires access to digital proof for the same reasons that the government does \u2013 because digital evidence can help find or bolster witnesses , establish a critical fact , or impeach a claim . But the preceding part also reveals just how little guidance exists , either as a matter of rules-based guidance or judicial opinion , for those attempting to craft a meaningful defense right to access and use this material . This part identifies the critical questions that must be answered , and values that must be weighed , in devising a regime of comprehensive access to such information for defensive or exculpatory purposes . 1. Who \u201c owns \u201d and who \u201c possesses \u201d the data . Perhaps the most important question with regard to technological forms of evidence is who owns and who possesses the data . Ownership is critical because , as with physical items , the right to share or disclose data often rests in the hands of the owner . Possession is also critical because , as with physical items , a possessor may disclose information surreptitiously without permission or knowledge of the owner . The most straightforward cases involve physical items owned and pos- sessed by the accused or a person sympathetic to the accused \u2019 s interest , in which the data is stored locally in the instrument . Such might be the case for a security camera owned by the defendant , or an electronic device with stored files . In these cases , the owner can make the evidence available to the defense . But many technological forms of evidence will not be accessed so sim- ply . As a general matter , ownership might be in public , governmental hands , such as police or public housing surveillance footage , or private hands , such as a private security camera . Even the category of private ownership is complex \u2013 ownership may be as simple as belonging to a private individual , or as complex as ownership held by a publicly traded large corporate entity . In some cases , ownership may even cross catego- ries . Digital information in particular may have multiple \u201c owners , \u201d e.g. , a user who uploads a picture to"}]}

Even when an owner is sympathetic or willing to share information with the defense , access may nonetheless be thwarted by an entity or per- son in possession of the data . Possession may also make access questions difficult because the reach of legal process may not extend to a physical site where information is kept . Possessors may also undermine the right of owners to exclude , e.g. , if a security company grants visual access to the interior of a home against the wishes of the owner . In both cases , obtaining data from third-party owners or possessors runs the further risk of disclosing defense strategies or theories . The gov- ernment may have the capacity to hide its use of technology behind con- tracts with non-disclosure clauses or vague references to \u201c confidential informants. \u201d Human Rights Watch has labeled this practice \u201c parallel con- struction \u201d and documented its use.70 But a criminal defendant may not be able to operate stealthily , relying instead on the goodwill of a third party not to disclose the effort or a court \u2019 s willingness to issue an ex parte order . 2. Who created the data . In many cases , answering questions of own- ership and possession will in turn answer the question of creation . But not always . An email may be drafted by one person , sent to a recipient who becomes its legal \u201c owner , \u201d and then possessed or stored by a third party . Or an entity may \u201c create \u201d information or data by collecting or analyzing material owned or possessed by another , e.g. , a DNA sample sent for pro- cessing through analytical software ; the data is created by the processing company , and the physical sample tested may be \u201c owned \u201d or possessed by the government . Data created by the defendant perhaps poses only ancillary obsta- cles when it comes to a defendant \u2019 s access to information . If any- thing , a defendant \u2019 s claim to having created data may bolster their claim to access , even if they neither own nor possess it.71 Some juris- dictions even specifically bestow upon an individual the right to access , correct , and delete data.72 But it may also be the case that the diffusion 70 \u201c Dark Side : Secret Origins of Evidence in US Criminal Cases ,"}]}

Imagine a piece of technology or evidence possessed by one party , owned by another person , and created by still another person \u2013 with disputes between the parties about whether or not to release the information . 3 . For what purpose was the data created . Another factor that must be considered in contemplating defense access is the source of the data and the purpose for which it was created . Much of the information that the defense may seek to access for exculpatory purposes will have likely been created for reasons unrelated to the criminal matter . For example , an automated vacuum may record the placement of the furniture in the room so that it can efficiently clean , but such data might be useful to show the layout at the time of the robbery . Or a search engine may store entered searches to optimize results and targeted advertising , but the record may suggest that a third party was the true killer . Such purpose need not be singular , either . The person searching the internet has one goal , but the internet search engine company has a different objective . The critical point is that the reason the information is there may help shed light on the propriety of defense access . By way of example , the most compelling case for unconstrained access to the defense might be for data that was created specifically for a law enforcement purpose . In the national security context in the United States , a statutory frame exists to resolve some of these claims.73 Conversely , the most difficult case for access might be for information privately created for personal purposes unrelated to the criminal case . Although no single factor should determine the capacity and scope of access , the extent to which data or information is created expressly with a criminal justice purpose in mind may shed light on the extent to which such information should also be made accessible to an accused . 4 .

Persons in heavily policed neighborhoods may fear that , after viewing an image in surveillance , attorneys will be incentivized to accuse a third party of the crime simply out of expedience rather than in good faith . But such concerns may be minimized when creators or owners voluntarily provide data to law enforcement for law enforce- ment purposes . 5 . How enduring or resilient is the data and who has the authority to destroy it . A central concern about defense access to data is that , without prompt and thorough access , such data will be destroyed before the defen- dant has a chance to request its preservation , if not disclosure . Some forms of evidence may be incredibly resilient . For example , cloud computing services or biometric identifiers of known persons may be highly resilient to destruction or elimination . But other forms of data may be transient in nature , or subject to deliber- ate interference by an unwilling owner or holder of the data . Surveillance cameras notoriously run on short time loops , automatically erasing and retaping data in limited increments . Social media or other sites may promise total erasure of deleted material , not just superficial elimination from a single device . Meaningful defense access to technological tools for exculpatory pur- poses requires attentiveness to timing , such that a defendant is able to access the material before its destruction . Even if the entitlement extends no farther than preservation , with actual access and use to be decided later , that would significantly impact a defendant \u2019 s capacity to make use of this information . 6 .

In the Catalan case above , the surveillance video that exonerated him was physically held by the stadium officials and the production company . Fortunately , it was rather confined , as it covered one day and one game . It was the defense attorney who pored through the footage , isolating the exculpatory images . But what if the records go beyond a single episode , or require special instrumentation to interpret . Information that requires that a holder devote significant time or resources to make the data available , or that is not readily shareable or accessible without expertise or instrumentation , may pose much more significant hurdles to open defense access . Some defense claims may actually be requests for access to services , rather than disclosure of information . For example , a defense request to run a DNA profile in the national database or to query a probabilistic geno- typing system with a different set of parameters is less about traditional disclosure than about commandeering the government \u2019 s resources to investigate a defense theory . The same could be true for location data from a witness \u2019 s phone or search records from a particular IP address . The sought information is less an item than a process , a process to be conducted by a third party , not the defense . 7 . What are the associated costs or expenses , and are there even available experts for the defense . A critical logistical , if not legal , hur- dle to defense access to digital and technological evidence is the cost associated with seeking , interpreting , and introducing such evidence . Most of the forms of evidence described require some degree of exper- tise to extract , interpret , and understand , much less to explain to a judge , attorney , or juror . To the extent that the information also seeks an operational process or other search measure , the owner or posses- sor of the information may justly charge a fee for such services .

Such costs can make defense lawyers reluctant even to pursue exculpatory evidence , because actually obtaining and using it appears insurmountable . One still more troubling possibility is that some subpoenaed parties will actively choose to defy orders rather than comply . As discussed above , social media companies Facebook and Twitter ( now X ) both refused to turn over posts requested by the defense in a criminal case , leading the judge to hold them in contempt and fine each $ 1,000 \u2013 the maximum allowed under the law.75 With fines capped statutorily , a company wealthy enough or unlikely to be a repeat player might simply choose non-compliance . 8 . What are the privacy implications of divulging the data . Perhaps the most apparent and central concern raised by defense access to digital data relates to privacy . The nature of the material sought and the scope of what it reveals , along with the number of persons implicated by defense disclosure , is perhaps equal only to concerns about unnecessary \u201c fishing expeditions \u201d or wasted resources as a basis for the reluctance to provide generous access to the defense . Whereas the government is bound to act in the interest of the public , and thus in theory should minimize harm to innocent third parties in the course of its investigations , the defense is entitled to act only in furtherance of the interest of the accused . At one end of the spectrum , some technological evidence will reveal deeply private or personal data belonging to a person wholly unrelated to the criminal offense . The DNA sequence or entire email history of a witness , or extensive public surveillance of a small community , obviously implicate profound interests . But at the other end of the spectrum , dis- crete bits of information created by the defendant him- or herself pose little concern when sought by the same defendant . And of course , non-digital forms of evidence can raise the same con- cerns ."}]}

In short , privacy is understandably a central and driving concern , but it should not be a definitive reason to close the door on broad defense access to exculpatory or defensive material . 9 . What legal restrictions , whether substantive , procedural , or jurisdictional , limit access or use . The final critical inquiry incorp- orates some aspects of the privacy concerns just discussed , but goes beyond them . Namely , any comprehensive effort to provide defense access to digital and technological evidence must square with existing legal regimes surrounding disclosure and use of such evidence , whether as a matter of comprehensive or targeted privacy laws , intellectual or physical property , trade secret , or evidence . At a basic level , the data may straddle jurisdictions \u2013 created in one place , processed in another , and then used somewhere else . Legal restrictions may also be loosely lumped into substantive and procedural limitations , differentiating between substantive constraints such as privacy laws and procedural impedi- ments such as jurisdictional rules . Background statutory regimes that may conflict with defense access are imperative to consider , because jurisdictions increasingly have adopted such restrictions in response to complaints about privacy.76 Although law enforcement is routinely afforded exceptions to privacy statutes,77 there is rarely any mention of any equivalent route of access for a criminal defendant.78 Moreover , even outside the realm of privacy law , there may be other statutory limitations on disclosure or access , such as legal non-disclosure agreements . Or jurisdictions may point to reg- ulatory regimes aimed at reliability as sufficient to safeguard all of the defendant \u2019 s interests.79 76 See e.g . Paul M.

Analyzing electronic information stored on suspects \u2019 mobile phones has become mandatory rather than optional .

This study aims to discuss methods for efficiently exploring such mobile messenger data within the aforementioned time constraints and extracting and analyzing information relevant to criminal charges .

This requires investigators to analyze extensive amounts of adjacent messages to understand the context . One of the most widely used methods by law enforcement agencies to search for crime-related electronic information within mobile messengers is keyword searching . For example , when conducting forensics on a drug suspect \u2019 s phone , investigators extract message data through various mobile forensic tools and filter chats containing specific keywords like \u201d drugs \u201d for investigation . \u2022 Solutions are needed to address the problem of investigators having to manually verify the context in which the message related to crime is located .

We then measured Cohen \u2019 s Kappa ( Cohen , 1960 ) to determine the quality of this annotation , and obtained a value of 0.74 . Cohen \u2019 s Kappa is a statistical measure used to assess the degree of agreement between two raters ( or annotators ) in classifying items into mutually exclusive categories . To evaluate the performance of our framework , we need to label the dataset mentioned in Section 5.2 whether they are truly related to drug crimes or they are just including slang or some metaphorical use of certain words . We asked two experienced investigators for labeling each single dataset whether it is actually related to drug crime or simply referring to figure of speech . F1-score is a metric that evaluates the balance between Precision and Recall , and measures the overall performance of the model through a harmonized average of the two metrics . In particular , it is used to comprehensively evaluate how well the model understands the drug-related context and effectively categorizes the relevant sentences . The F1-score is calculated as : Hallucination refers to the phenomenon where a large language model ( LLM ) produces information that does not actually exist or incorrect information ( Maynez et al. , 2020 ) . These errors can occur during the process of inference or deduction from the data on which the model was trained , and can be particularly problematic in fact-based tasks . In general , hallucinations can degrade the reliability and accuracy of a model , making them an important metric when evaluating model performance . We define a hallucination as a case where the LLM incorrectly judges the ground truth to be 1 when it is 0 . Based on this definition , we calculate the Hallucination Rate as the rate at which the model produces incorrect outputs that do not match the actual data , and use this metric to assess whether the investigation . The model \u2019 s output Hallucination Rate is calculated as : Preprint not peer reviewed In our study , we use Precision , Recall , F1-score , and Hallucination Rate to evaluate how well large language models can discriminate between actual drug crimes and figurative expressions in message data .

Firstly , we keyword-searched for sentences containing the certain word \u201d drugs \u201d , and created a set of messages by grouping preceding and following text messages . We then asked LLMs for judging their relevance to drug crimes based on the context"}]}

However this method excludes the possibilities of crime-related messages written in metaphorical terms or indirect terms . Therefore , Future research should move beyond simply keywordsearching the certain words , embed the entire data to more sophisticatedly analyze the semantic similarity between messages and the target words or sentences . We expect this method to overcome the limitations and extract more accurate information that takes into account more complex contexts . Preprint not peer reviewed Secondly , we experienced that our suggested framework is subject to each of the policies of LLMs . Sometimes they offer only limited responses to topics such as crime , violence , and drug dealing for user protection and safety . In addition , these LLMs prevent themselves from learning continuously updated laws or confidential investigative data ( Kim et al. , 2024 ) , and they pose security concerns due to the risk of exposing sensitive information from criminal cases while using the API ( Liu et al. , 2023 ) . To overcome these constraints and provide more accurate and secure customized responses for Law Enforcement Agencies , we should consider implementing a local model which is relatively small sized or customized for special fields of knowledge . Last but not least , prompt engineering has several limitations when applied to sensitive and context- dependent domains such as criminal investigation . In particular , the structure and wording of the prompts directly affect the performance of the model , and even simple structural changes can lead to significant changes in the generalization performance of the model ( Schick and Schu\u00a8tze , 2020 ; Zhao et al. , 2021 ) . When analyzing how effectively each model extracts information relevant to the alleged crime in real-world investigative situations , GPT-4o performed well , with the highest overall recall and F1 score . In contrast , Gemini had a lower recall but fewer false positives , and Claude had relatively low precision . The results of this performance analysis of each model are important to understand the strengths and limitations of each model , and we figure out that the majority voting method compensates for the conflicts between the models to produce stable and reliable results . This research presents a comprehensive framework for digital forensics , aiming to enhance the efficiency of investigators in sifting through crucial evidence for proving alleged crimes , thereby reducing investigation timeframes . The framework encompasses data extraction from diverse mobile devices using forensic software , preprocessing the obtained data , and applying prompt engineering to comprehend the context . This approach proves invaluable when rapid data analysis is required , facilitating the intuitive clues within constrained time limits . We can utilize a Retrieval Augmented Generation ( RAG ) model for an alternative ( Gao et al. , 2023 ) . RAG models work by searching for relevant documents in realtime to add information that can be referenced when generating answers , rather"}]}

For future work , we suggest an adaptive prompting framework to compensate for these issues , in which the prompts can be dynamically adjusted according to the complexity and context of the input data . For example , there is a need to design hierarchical prompts that help the model understand the context step by step instead of processing all the details at once ( Schick and Schu\u00a8tze , 2020 ) . In addition , we hope to combine prompt engineering with few shot learning to design prompts with representative examples , which will allow the model to generalize in complex and diverse situations ( Gao et al. , 2020 ) .

The past few decades have witnessed a dramatic transformation in the way we shop , bank , and go about our daily business\u2014changes that have resulted in an un- precedented proliferation of records and data . Small details that were once captured in dim memories or fading scraps of paper are now preserved forever in the digital minds of computers , in vast databases with fertile \ufb01elds of personal data . Our wallets are stu\ufb00ed with ATM cards , calling cards , frequent shopper cards , and credit cards\u2014all of which can be used to record where we are and what we do . Every day , rivulets of information stream into electric brains to be sifted , sorted , rearranged , and combined in hundreds of di\ufb00erent ways .

Data is digitized into binary numerical form , which enables computers to store and manipulate it with unprecedented e\ufb03ciency . There are hundreds of companies that are constructing gigantic databases of psychological pro\ufb01les , amassing data about an individual \u2019 s race , gen- der , income , hobbies , and purchases . Shards of data from our daily existence are now being assembled and analyzed\u2014to investigate backgrounds , check credit , market products , and make a wide variety of decisions a\ufb00ecting our lives . This book is about how we should understand and protect privacy in light of these profound technological developments . Our old con- ceptions of privacy are not up to the task . Much of the law pertaining to privacy is based on these conceptions , and as a result , it has failed to resolve the emerging privacy problems created by digital dossiers . This book aims to rethink longstanding notions of privacy to grapple with the consequences of living in an Information Age . The Problems of Digital Dossiers New Technologies and New Problems . In earlier times , communities were small and intimate . Personal information was preserved in the mem- ories of friends , family , and neighbors , and it was spread by gossip and storytelling . Today , the predominant mode of spreading informa- tion is not through the \ufb02utter of gossiping tongues but through the language of electricity , where information pulses between massive record systems and databases . On the upside , this development means that individuals can more readily escape from the curious eyes of the community , freeing themselves from sti\ufb02ing social norms in- hibiting individuality and creativity . On the downside , an ever-grow- ing series of records is created about almost every facet of a person \u2019 s life . As businesses and the government increasingly share personal information , digital dossiers about nearly every individual are being assembled . This raises serious concerns . The information gathered about us has become quite extensive , and it is being used in ways that profoundly a\ufb00ect our lives . Yet , we know little about how our personal information is being used , and we lack the power to do much about it . i n t r o d u c t i o n \u25b2 Digital dossiers are constructed and used through three types of \u201c information \ufb02ow. \u201d 1 Information \ufb02ow is a way of describing the movement of data . Like water in an elaborate system of plumbing , data \ufb02ows through information pipelines linking various businesses , organizations , and government entities . First , information often \ufb02ows between large computer databases of private-sector companies . Sec- ond , data \ufb02ows from government public record systems to a variety of businesses in the private sector . Indeed , many companies construct their databases by culling personal data from public records . Third ,"}]}

The increase in digital dossiers has thus resulted in an elaborate lattice of information networking , where information is being stored , analyzed , and used in ways that have profound implications for society . Even if we \u2019 re not aware of it , the use of digital dossiers is shaping our lives . Companies use digital dossiers to determine how they do business with us ; \ufb01nancial institutions use them to determine whether to give us credit ; employers turn to them to examine our backgrounds when hiring ; law enforcement o\ufb03cials draw on them to investigate us ; and identity thieves tap into them to commit fraud . Computer Databases . Computers and cyberspace have vastly in- creased our ability to collect , store , and analyze information . Today , it seems as if everyone is collecting information\u2014the media , employ- ers , businesses , and government . Countless companies maintain computerized records of their customers \u2019 preferences , purchases , and activities . There are hundreds of records detailing an individual \u2019 s consumption . Credit card companies maintain information about one \u2019 s credit card purchases . Video stores keep records about one \u2019 s video rentals . Online retailers , such as Amazon.com , preserve records of all the books and other items a person buys . And there are hun- dreds of companies people aren \u2019 t even aware of that maintain their personal information . For example , Wiland Services maintains a database of about \uf731 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 di\ufb00erent points of information on over \uf732\uf731\uf735 million individuals.2 Acxiom.com collects and sells data on con- sumers to marketers . In its InfoBase , it provides \u201c [ o ] ver \uf735\uf730 demo- graphic variables . . . including age , income , real property data , \u25b2 i n t r o d u c t i o n children \u2019 s data , and others. \u201d It also contains data on education levels , occupation , height , weight , political a\ufb03liation , ethnicity , race , hob- bies , and net worth.3 Computers enable marketers to collect detailed dossiers of per- sonal information and to analyze it to predict the consumer \u2019 s behav- ior . Through various analytic techniques , marketers construct models of what products particular customers will desire and how to encour- age customers to consume . Companies know how we spend our money , what we do for a living , how much we earn , and where we live . They know about our ethnic backgrounds , religion , political views , and health problems . Not only do companies know what we have al- ready purchased , but they also have a good idea about what books we will soon buy or what movies we will want to see . Public Records . Imagine that the government had the power"}]}

Then imagine that the government routinely poured this informa- tion into the public domain\u2014by posting it on the Internet where it could be accessed from all over the world , by giving it away to any in- dividual or company that asked for it , or even by providing entire databases of personal information upon request . Think about how this information would be available to those who make important de- cisions about an individual \u2019 s life and career\u2014such as whether the in- dividual will get a loan or a job . Also consider that , in many cases , the individual would not even know that the information is being used to make these decisions . Imagine as well that this information would be traded among hun- dreds of private-sector companies that would combine it with a host of other information such as one \u2019 s hobbies , purchases , magazines , or- ganizations , credit history , and so on . This expanded pro\ufb01le would i n t r o d u c t i o n \u25b2 then be sold back to the government in order to investigate and mon- itor individuals more e\ufb03ciently . Stop imagining . What I described is a growing reality in the United States , and the threat posed to privacy is rapidly becoming worse . Federal , state , and local governments maintain public records span- ning an individual \u2019 s life from birth to death . These records contain a myriad of personal details . Until recently , public records were di\ufb03cult to access\u2014\ufb01nding information about a person often involved a scav- enger hunt through local o\ufb03ces to dig up records . But with the Inter- net , public records are increasingly being posted online , where anybody anywhere can easily obtain and search them . Government Access . The data in digital dossiers increasingly \ufb02ows from the private sector to the government , particularly for law en- forcement use . Law enforcement agencies have long sought personal information about individuals from various companies and \ufb01nancial institutions to investigate fraud , white-collar crime , drug tra\ufb03cking , computer crime , child pornography , and other types of criminal ac- tivity . In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September \uf731\uf731 , \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731 , the impetus for the government to gather personal information has greatly increased , since this data can be useful to track down"}]}

Many people communicate over the Internet using a screen name or pseudonym ; the data in digital dossiers can unveil their identities as well as expose all of the people with whom they associate and do business . The government has recently been exploring ways to develop tech- nology to detect patterns of behavior based on our dossiers . In \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732 , it was revealed that the Department of Defense was developing a pro- gram called Total Information Awareness ( since renamed Terrorism Information Awareness ) . The program begins with the government amassing personal information from private-sector sources into a massive database of dossiers on individuals . Pro\ufb01ling technology is then used to detect those who are likely to be engaged in criminal \u25b2 i n t r o d u c t i o n activity . When Congress learned of Total Information Awareness , it halted the program because of its threat to privacy . However , the same type of collection and use of data envisioned by those who dreamed up Total Information Awareness is already being carried out by the government . The digital dossiers that continue to grow in the private sector and in public records are now becoming a tool for the government to monitor and investigate people . What Is the Problem ? The growing collection and use of personal infor- mation in digital form has long been viewed as problematic\u2014a fear typically raised under the banner of \u201c privacy. \u201d The use of personal in- formation certainly presents privacy problems , but what exactly is the nature of these problems ? Although the problems of personal in- formation are understood as concerns over privacy , beyond this , they are often not well de\ufb01ned . How much weight should our vague appre- hensions be given , especially considering the tremendous utility , pro\ufb01t , and e\ufb03ciency of using personal information ? The answer to this question depends upon how these privacy problems are conceptualized . Unfortunately , so far , the problems have not been adequately articulated . Many discussions of privacy merely scratch the surface by simply pointing out a series of techno- logical developments with the assumption that people will react with anxiety . Rarely do discussions about privacy delve deeper . We need a better understanding of the problems ; we must learn how they devel- oped , how they are connected , what precisely they threaten , and how they can be solved . This book aims to reconceptualize privacy in today \u2019 s world of rap- idly changing technology . The task of conceptualizing the privacy problems digital dossiers"}]}

As John Dewey aptly wrote , \u201c a problem well put is half-solved. \u201d 4 We can \u2019 t really solve a problem until we know the harm that it causes . A good diag- nosis of a problem goes a long way toward \ufb01nding solutions to it . The goal of this book extends beyond articulating a new under- standing of contemporary privacy problems ; the book also aims to demonstrate the ways that the problems can be solved . In particular , this is a book about the law . A relatively robust amount of law has de- veloped to protect privacy , but it has often failed to be e\ufb00ective when i n t r o d u c t i o n \u25b2 confronted by the problems of the Information Age . This book dis- cusses why this has happened and what can be done about it . Traditional Conceptions of Privacy Traditionally , privacy violations have been understood in a particular manner . In this book , I contend that these ways of understanding pri- vacy must be rethought in order to fully comprehend the problems with digital dossiers . This doesn \u2019 t mean that these understandings are incorrect . They arose with earlier privacy problems and can certainly be of help in understanding digital dossiers . But these more tradi- tional ways of understanding privacy don \u2019 t account for key aspects of the unique problems the digital age has introduced . Orwell \u2019 s Big Brother . The dominant metaphor for modern invasions of privacy is Big Brother , the ruthless totalitarian government in George Orwell \u2019 s novel 1984 . Big Brother oppresses its citizens , purges dis- senters , and spies on everyone in their homes . The result is a cold , drab , grey world with hardly any space for love , joy , original thinking , spontaneity , or creativity . It is a society under total control . Although the metaphor has proven quite useful for a number of privacy prob- lems , it only partially captures the problems of digital dossiers . Big Brother envisions a centralized authoritarian power that aims for ab- solute control , but the digital dossiers constructed by businesses aren \u2019 t controlled by a central power , and their goal is not to oppress us but to get us to buy new products and services . Even our government is a far cry from Big Brother , for most government o\ufb03cials don \u2019 t act out of malicious intent or a desire for domination . Moreover , Big Brother achieves its control by brutally punishing people for disobe- dience and making people fear they are constantly being watched . But businesses don \u2019 t punish us so long as we keep on buying , and they don \u2019 t make us feel as though we are being watched . To the con- trary"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ", they try to gather information as inconspicuously as possible . Making us feel threatened would undermine rather than advance the goal of unencumbered information collection . Finally , while Big Brother aims to control the most intimate details of a citizen \u2019 s life , much of the information in digital dossiers is not intimate or unusual . \u25b2 i n t r o d u c t i o n The Secrecy Paradigm . In another traditional way of understanding pri- vacy that I refer to as the \u201c secrecy paradigm , \u201d privacy is invaded by uncovering one \u2019 s hidden world , by surveillance , and by the disclosure of concealed information . The harm such invasions cause consists of inhibition , self-censorship , embarrassment , and damage to one \u2019 s rep- utation . The law is heavily in\ufb02uenced by this paradigm . As a result , if the information isn \u2019 t secret , then courts often conclude that the infor- mation can \u2019 t be private . However , this conception of privacy is not re- sponsive to life in the modern Information Age , where most personal information exists in the record systems of hundreds of entities . Life today is fueled by information , and it is virtually impossible to live as an Information Age ghost , leaving no trail or residue . The Invasion Conception . Under the traditional view , privacy is violated by the invasive actions of particular wrongdoers who cause direct in- jury to victims . Victims experience embarrassment , mental distress , or harm to their reputations . The law responds when a person \u2019 s deep- est secrets are exposed , reputation is tarnished , or home is invaded . This view , which I call the \u201c invasion conception , \u201d understands pri- vacy to be a kind of invasion , in which somebody invades and some- body is invaded . However , digital dossiers often do not result in any overt invasion . People frequently don \u2019 t experience any direct injury when data about them is aggregated or transferred from one com- pany to another . Moreover , many of the problems of digital dossiers emerge from the collaboration of a multitude of di\ufb00erent actors with di\ufb00erent purposes . Each step along the way is relatively small and in- nocuous , failing to cause harm that the invasion conception would recognize as substantial . Rethinking Privacy Digital dossiers pose signi\ufb01cant problems , and for a more complete understanding of these issues , I turn to another metaphor\u2014Franz Kafka \u2019 s depiction of bureaucracy in The Trial . Kafka \u2019 s novel chronicles the surreal nightmare of a person who is unexpectedly informed that he is under arrest but given no reason why . A bureaucratic court maintains a dossier about him , but he has no access to this informa- i n t r o d u c t i o n"}]}

Throughout the rest of the novel , the protagonist desperately at- tempts to \ufb01nd out why the Court is interested in his life , but his quest is hopeless\u2014the Court is too clandestine and labyrinthine to be fully understood . The Trial captures an individual \u2019 s sense of helplessness , frustra- tion , and vulnerability when a large bureaucratic organization has control over a vast dossier of details about one \u2019 s life . Bureaucracy of- ten results in a routinized and sometimes careless way of handling in- formation\u2014with little to no accountability . This makes people vulnerable to identity theft , stalking , and other harms . The problem is not simply a loss of control over personal information , nor is there a diabolical motive or plan for domination as with Big Brother . The problem is a bureaucratic process that is uncontrolled . These bureau- cratic ways of using our information have palpable e\ufb00ects on our lives because people use our dossiers to make important decisions about us to which we are not always privy . Thus far , the existing law protecting information privacy has not adequately responded to the emergence of digital dossiers . We need to better articulate what the problems are , what is at stake , and what precisely the law must do to solve the problems . We must rethink pri- vacy for the Information Age . A Roadmap for This Book In part I , I explore the digital dossiers about individuals that are being assembled through computer databases and the Internet . I focus pri- marily on the activities of businesses . Chapter \uf732 traces the history of the developing privacy problems precipitated by computer databases and cyberspace . In chapter \uf733 , I examine the prevailing ways that these privacy problems have been conceptualized . I discuss the predomi- nance of the Orwell metaphor and why it must be supplemented with the Kafka metaphor . Chapter \uf734 discusses why the law of information privacy has failed to grapple adequately with the problem of digital dossiers . Chapter \uf735 responds to those who argue that the market ( alone or with some minor tinkering ) can appropriately deal with the problem . In chapter \uf736 , I argue that beyond a set of individual rights , protecting privacy requires an architecture that regulates the way \u25b2 i n t r o d u c t i o n information may be collected and used . Consequently , protecting privacy must focus not merely on remedies and penalties for ag- grieved individuals but on shaping an architecture to govern the ever- increasing data \ufb02ows of the Information Age .

A History of Public-Sector Databases Although personal records have been kept for centuries,1 only in con- temporary times has the practice become a serious concern . Prior to the nineteenth century , few public records were collected , and most of them were kept at a very local level , often by institutions associated with churches.2 The federal government \u2019 s early endeavors at collect- ing data consisted mainly in conducting the census . The \ufb01rst census in \uf731\uf737\uf739\uf730 asked only four questions.3 With each proceeding census , the government gathered more personal information . By \uf731\uf738\uf736\uf730 , \uf731\uf734\uf732 ques- tions were asked.4 When the \uf731\uf738\uf739\uf730 census included questions about diseases , disabilities , and \ufb01nances , it sparked a public outcry ,"}]}

The creation and growth of government bu- reaucracy\u2014spawning well over \uf731\uf730\uf730 federal agencies within the past century\u2014led to an insatiable thirst for information about individuals . One such agency was the Social Security Administration , created in \uf731\uf739\uf733\uf735 , which assigned nine-digit numbers to each citizen and required extensive record-keeping of people \u2019 s earnings . Technology was a primary factor in the rise of information collec- tion . The \uf731\uf738\uf738\uf730 census required almost \uf731 , \uf735\uf730\uf730 clerks to tally information tediously by hand\u2014and it took seven years to complete.6 At the rapid rate of population growth , if a faster way could not be found to tabu- late the information , the \uf731\uf738\uf739\uf730 census wouldn \u2019 t be completed before the \uf731\uf739\uf730\uf730 census began . Fortunately , just in time for the \uf731\uf738\uf739\uf730 census , a census o\ufb03cial named Herman Hollerith developed an innovative tabulating device\u2014a machine that read holes punched in cards.7 Hol- lerith \u2019 s new machine helped tabulate the \uf731\uf738\uf739\uf730 census in under three years.8 Hollerith left the Census Bureau and founded a small \ufb01rm that produced punch card machines\u2014a \ufb01rm that through a series of mergers eventually formed the company that became IBM.9 IBM \u2019 s subsequent rise to prosperity was due , in signi\ufb01cant part , to the government \u2019 s increasing need for data . The Social Security System and other New Deal programs required a vast increase in records that had to be kept about individuals . As a result , the government became one of the largest purchasers of IBM \u2019 s punch card machines.10 The So- cial Security Administration kept most of its records on punch cards , and by \uf731\uf739\uf734\uf733 it had more than \uf731\uf730\uf730 million cards in storage.11 The advent of the mainframe computer in \uf731\uf739\uf734\uf736 revolutionized in- formation collection . The computer and magnetic tape enabled the systematic storage of data . As processing speeds accelerated and as memory ballooned , computers provided a vastly increased ability to collect , search , analyze , and transfer records . Federal and state agencies began to computerize their records . The Census Bureau was one of the earliest purchasers of commercially available computers.12 Social Security numbers ( SSNs ) \u2014originally not to be used as identi\ufb01ers beyond the Social Security System\u2014became immensely useful for computer databases.13 This is because SSNs en- t h e r i s e o f t h e d i g i t a l d o s s i e r \u25b2 able data to be easily linked to particular individuals .

Privacy captured the at- tention of the public , and a number of philosophers , legal scholars , and other commentators turned their attention to the threats to pri- vacy caused by the rise of the computer.15 Congress began to debate how to respond to these emerging developments.16 In \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf733 , the U.S. Department of Health , Education , and Welfare ( HEW ) issued a report entitled Records , Computers , and the Rights of Citizens , which tren- chantly articulated the growing concerns over computerized record systems : There was a time when information about an individual tended to be elicited in face-to-face contacts involving personal trust and a certain symmetry , or balance , between giver and receiver . Nowadays , an individual must increasingly give information about himself to large and relatively faceless institutions , for handling and use by strangers\u2014unknown , unseen , and , all too frequently , unresponsive . Sometimes the individual does not even know that an organization maintains a record about him . Often he may not see it , much less contest its accuracy , control its dissemination , or challenge its use by others.17 These problems continued to escalate throughout the ensuing decades . Computers grew vastly more powerful , and computerized records became ubiquitous . The rise of the Internet in the \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf730s added new dimensions to these problems , sparking a revolution in the collection , accessibility , and communication of personal data . Today , federal agencies and departments maintain almost \uf732 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 databases,18 including records pertaining to immigration , bankruptcy , licensing , welfare , and countless other matters . In a recent e\ufb00ort to track down parents who fail to pay child support , the federal govern- ment has created a vast database consisting of information about all people who obtain a new job anywhere in the nation . The database contains their SSNs , addresses , and wages.19 \u25b2 t h e r i s e o f t h e d i g i t a l d o s s i e r States maintain public records of arrests , births , criminal proceed- ings , marriages , divorces , property ownership , voter registration , workers \u2019 compensation , and scores of other types of records . State li- censing regimes mandate that records be kept on numerous profes- sionals such as doctors , lawyers , engineers , insurance agents , nurses , police , accountants , and teachers .

Long before the rise of nationwide advertising campaigns there was a personal relationship between merchant and customer . Local merchants lived next door to their customers and learned about their lives from their existence together in the community . To a large ex- tent , marketing was done locally\u2014by the peddler on the street or the shopkeeper on the corner . Mass marketing , which began in the nine- teenth century and \ufb02ourished in the twentieth century , transformed the nature of selling from personal one-to-one persuasion to large- scale advertising campaigns designed for the nameless , faceless American consumer . Mass marketing consumed vast fortunes , and only a small fraction of the millions of people exposed to the ads would buy the products or services . Soon marketers discovered the power of a new form of marketing\u2014targeted marketing . The idea was to \ufb01gure out which people were most likely to consume a product and focus the advertis- ing on them . In the \uf731\uf739\uf732\uf730s , the sales department of General Motors Corporation began an early experiment with targeted marketing . GM discovered that owners of Ford vehicles frequently didn \u2019 t purchase a Ford as their next vehicle\u2014so it targeted owners of two-year-old Fords and sent them a brochure on GM vehicles.20 GM then began to send out ques- tionnaires asking for consumer input into their products . GM be- t h e r i s e o f t h e d i g i t a l d o s s i e r \u25b2 lieved that this would be a good marketing device , presenting the im- age of a big corporation that cared enough to listen to the opinions of everyday people . GM cast itself as a democratic institution , its sur- veys stating that it was \u201c OF the people , FOR the people , BY the people. \u201d One GM print advertisement depicted a delighted child holding up the survey letter exclaiming : \u201c Look dad , a letter from Gen- eral Motors ! \u201d The campaign was quite successful\u2014ironically not be- cause of the data collected but because of GM \u2019 s image of appearing to be interested in the consumer \u2019 s ideas.21 Today , corporations are desperate for whatever consumer infor- mation they can glean , and their quest for information is hardly per- ceived as democratic . The data collected extends beyond information about consumers \u2019 views of the product to information about the con- sumers themselves , often including lifestyle details and even a full- scale psychological pro\ufb01le . The turn to targeting was spurred by the proliferation and special- ization of mass media throughout the century , enabling marketers to tap into groups of consumers with similar interests and tastes . The most basic form of targeting involved selecting particular television programs , radio shows , or magazines in which to place advertise- ments . This technique ,"}]}

The most revolutionary developments in targeted marketing oc- curred in the direct marketing industry . The practice of sending mail order catalogs directly to consumers began in the late nineteenth century when railroads extended the reach of the mail system.22 The industry also reached out to people by way of door-to-door salesper- sons . In the \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730s , marketers began calling people directly on the tele- phone , and \u201c telemarketing \u201d was born . Direct marketing remained a \ufb02edgling practice for most of the twentieth century . Direct marketers had long accepted the \u201c \uf732 per- cent \u201d rule\u2014only \uf732 percent of those contacted would respond.23 With such a staggering failure rate , direct marketing achieved its successes at great cost . To increase the low response rate , marketers sought to sharpen their targeting techniques , which required more consumer research and an e\ufb00ective way to collect , store , and analyze information \u25b2 t h e r i s e o f t h e d i g i t a l d o s s i e r about consumers . The advent of the computer database gave mar- keters this long sought-after ability\u2014and it launched a revolution in targeting technology . Databases provided an e\ufb03cient way to store and search for data . Organized into \ufb01elds of information , the database enabled marketers to sort by various types of information and to rank or select various groups of individuals from its master list of customers\u2014a practice called \u201c modeling. \u201d Through this process , fewer mailings or calls needed to be made , resulting in a higher response rate and lower costs . In addition to isolating a company \u2019 s most pro\ufb01table customers , marketers studied them , pro\ufb01led them , and then used that pro\ufb01le to \ufb01nd similar customers.24 This , of course , required not only informa- tion about existing customers , but the collection of data about prospective customers as well . Originally , marketers sought to locate the best customers by identi- fying those customers who purchased items most recently and fre- quently and who spent the most money.25 In the \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730s , marketers turned to demographic information.26 Demographics included basic information such as age , income level , race , ethnicity , gender , and ge- ographical location . Marketers could target certain demographic seg- ments of the nation , a practice called \u201c cluster marketing. \u201d This approach worked because people with similar incomes and races generally lived together in clusters . The private sector obtained this demographic information from the federal government . In the \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730s , the United States began selling its census data on magnetic tapes . To protect privacy , the Census Bu- reau sold the information in clusters of \uf731 , \uf735\uf730\uf730 households , supplying only addresses\u2014not names .

Within \ufb01ve years of purchasing the census data , these companies had constructed demographically segmented databases of over half of the households in the nation.27 In the \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf730s , marketers looked to supplement their data about con- sumers by compiling \u201c psychographic \u201d information\u2014data about psy- chological characteristics such as opinions , attitudes , beliefs , and lifestyles.28 For example , one company established an elaborate tax- t h e r i s e o f t h e d i g i t a l d o s s i e r \u25b2 onomy of people , with category names such as \u201c Blue Blood Estates , \u201d \u201c Bohemian Mix , \u201d \u201c Young Literati , \u201d \u201c Shotguns and Pickups , \u201d and \u201c His- panic Mix. \u201d 29 Each cluster had a description of the type of person , their likes , incomes , race and ethnicity , attitudes , and hobbies.30 These innovations made targeted marketing\u2014or \u201c database mar- keting \u201d as it is often referred to today\u2014the hottest form of marketing , growing at twice the rate of America \u2019 s gross national product.31 In \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731 , direct marketing resulted in almost $ \uf732 trillion in sales.32 On average , over \uf735\uf730\uf730 pieces of unsolicited advertisements , catalogs , and market- ing mailings arrive every year at each household.33 Due to targeting , direct mail yields $ \uf731\uf730 in sales for every $ \uf731 in cost\u2014a ratio double that for a television advertisement\u2014and forecasters predict catalog sales will grow faster than retail sales.34 Telemarketing is a $ \uf736\uf736\uf732 billion a year industry.35 In a \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf736 Gallup poll , \uf737\uf737 percent of U.S. companies used some form of direct mail , targeted email , or telemarketing.36 The e\ufb00ectiveness of targeted marketing depends upon data , and the challenge is to obtain as much of it as possible . Marketers discov- ered that they didn \u2019 t have to research and collect all the information from scratch , for data is the perspiration of the Information Age . Bil- lions of bytes are released each second as we click , charge , and call . A treasure trove of information already lay untapped within existing databases , retail records , mailing lists , and government records . All that marketers had to do was plunder it as e\ufb03ciently as possible . The increasing thirst for personal information spawned the cre- ation of a new industry : the database industry , an Information Age bazaar where personal data collections are bartered and sold . Mar- keters \u201c rent \u201d lists of names and personal information from database companies , which charge a few cents to a dollar for each name.37 Over \uf735\uf735\uf730 companies compose the personal information industry , with an- nual revenues in the billions of dollars.38 The sale of mailing lists alone ("}]}

Based in business to the collection of personal Florida , Catalina Marketing Corporation maintains supermarket buying history databases on \uf733\uf730 million households from more than \uf735 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 stores.41 This data contains a complete inventory of one \u2019 s gro- ceries , over-the-counter medications , hygiene supplies , and contra- ceptive devices , among others . Aristotle , Inc. markets a database of \uf731\uf735\uf730 million registered voters . Aristotle \u2019 s database records voters \u2019 names , addresses , phone numbers , party a\ufb03liation , and voting fre- quency . Aristotle combines this data with about \uf732\uf735 other categories of information , such as one \u2019 s race , income , and employer\u2014even the make and model of one \u2019 s car . It markets a list of wealthy campaign donors called \u201c Fat Cat. \u201d Aristotle boasts : \u201c Hit your opponent in the Wallet ! Using Fat Cats , you can ferret out your adversary \u2019 s contribu- tors and slam them with a mail piece explaining why they shouldn \u2019 t donate money to the other side. \u201d 42 Another company manufactures software called GeoVoter , which combines about \uf735 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 categories of information about a voter to calculate how that individual will vote.43 The most powerful database builders construct information em- pires , sometimes with information on more than half of the American population . For example , Donnelley Marketing Information Services of New Jersey keeps track of \uf731\uf732\uf735 million people . Wiland Services has constructed a database containing over \uf731 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 elements , from demo- graphic information to behavioral data , on over \uf732\uf731\uf735 million people . There are around \ufb01ve database compilers that have data on almost all households in the United States.44 Beyond marketers , hundreds of companies keep data about us in their record systems . The complete bene\ufb01ts of the Information Age do not simply come to us\u2014we must \u201c plug in \u201d to join in . In other words , we must establish relationships with Internet Service Providers , cable companies , phone companies , insurance compa- nies , and so on .

In modern society , however , people are highly mobile and creditors often lack \ufb01rst-hand experience of the \ufb01nancial condition and trust- worthiness of individuals . Therefore , creditors rely upon credit re- porting agencies to obtain information about a person \u2019 s credit history . Credit reports reveal a person \u2019 s consistency in paying back debts as well as the person \u2019 s loan defaulting risk . People are assigned a credit score , which impacts whether they will be extended credit , and , if so , what rate of interest will be charged . Credit reports con- tain a detailed \ufb01nancial history , \ufb01nancial account information , out- standing debts , bankruptcy \ufb01lings , judgments , liens , and mortgage foreclosures . Today , there are three major credit reporting agencies\u2014 Equifax , Experian , and Trans Union . Each agency has compiled ex- tensive dossiers about almost every adult U.S. citizen.49 Credit reports have become essential to securing a loan , obtaining a job , purchasing a home or a car , applying for a license , or even renting an apartment . Credit reporting agencies also prepare investigative consumer re- ports , which supplement the credit report with information about an individual \u2019 s character and lifestyle.50 Launched in \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732 , Regulatory DataCorp ( RDC ) has created a mas- sive database to investigate people opening new bank accounts . RDC was created by many of the world \u2019 s largest \ufb01nancial companies . Its database , named the Global Regulatory Information Database ( GRID ) , gathers information from over \uf732\uf730 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 di\ufb00erent sources around the world.51 RDC \u2019 s purpose is to help \ufb01nancial companies conduct background checks of potential customers for fraud , money laundering , terrorism , and other criminal activity .

Each page contains spaces reserved for advertisements , and speci\ufb01c advertisements are downloaded into those spots . The dy- namic nature of web pages makes it possible for a page to download di\ufb00erent advertisements for di\ufb00erent users . Targeting is very important for web advertising because a web page is cluttered with information and images all vying for the users \u2019 atten- tion . Similar to the response rates of earlier e\ufb00orts at direct market- ing , only a small percentage of viewers ( about \uf732 percent ) click the advertisements they view.59 The Internet \u2019 s greater targeting potential and the \ufb01erce competition for the consumer \u2019 s attention have given companies an unquenchable thirst for information about web users . This information is useful in developing more targeted advertising as well as in enabling companies to better assess the performance and popularity of various parts of their websites . Currently , there are two basic ways that websites collect personal information . First , many websites directly solicit data from their users . Numerous websites require users to register and log in , and registration often involves answering a questionnaire . Online mer- chants amass data from their business transactions with consumers . For example , I shop on Amazon.com , which keeps track of my pur- chases in books , videos , music , and other items . I can view its records of every item I \u2019 ve ever ordered , and this goes back well over six years . When I click on this option , I get an alphabetized list of everything I bought and the date I bought it . Amazon.com uses its extensive records to recommend new books and videos . With a click , I can see dozens of books that Amazon.com thinks I \u2019 ll be interested in . It is eerily good , and it can pick out books for me better than my relatives can . It has me pegged . Websites can also secretly track a customer \u2019 s websur\ufb01ng . When a person explores a website , the website can record data about her ISP , computer hardware and software , the website she linked from , and \u25b2 t h e r i s e o f t h e d i g i t a l d o s s i e r exactly what parts of the website she explored and for how long . This information is referred to as \u201c clickstream data \u201d because it is a trail of how a user navigates throughout the web by clicking on various links . It enables the website to calculate how many times it has been visited and what parts are most popular . With a way to connect this"}]}

This is a unique vision , for while marketers can measure the size of audiences for other media such as television , radio , books , and magazines , they have little ability to measure attention span . Due to the interactive nature of the Internet , marketers can learn how we respond to what we hear and see . A website collects information about the way a user interacts with the site and stores the information in its database . This information will enable the website to learn about the interests of a user so it can better target advertisements to the user . For example , Amazon.com can keep track of every book or item that a customer browses but does not purchase . To connect this information with particular users , a company can either require a user to log in or it can secretly tag a user to recognize her when she returns . This latter form of identi\ufb01cation occurs through what is called a \u201c cookie. \u201d A cookie is a small text \ufb01le of codes that is deployed into the user \u2019 s computer when she downloads a web page.60 Websites place a unique identi\ufb01cation code into the cookie , and the cookie is saved on the user \u2019 s hard drive . When the user visits the site again , the site looks for its cookie , recognizes the user , and lo- cates the information it collected about the user \u2019 s previous sur\ufb01ng ac- tivity in its database . Basically , a cookie works as a form of high-tech cattle-branding . Cookies have certain limits . First , they often are not tagged to par- ticular individuals\u2014just to particular computers . However , if the website requires a user to log in or asks for a name , then the cookies will often contain data identifying the individual . Second , typically , websites can only decipher the cookies that they placed on a user \u2019 s computer ; they can not use cookies stored by a di\ufb00erent website . To get around these limitations , companies have devised strategies of information sharing with other websites . One of the most popular information sharing techniques is performed by a \ufb01rm called Dou- bleClick . When a person visits a website , it often takes a quick detour t h e r i s e o f t h e d i g i t a l d o s s i e r \u25b2 to DoubleClick . DoubleClick accesses its cookie on the person \u2019 s com- puter and looks up its pro\ufb01le about the person . Based on the pro\ufb01le , DoubleClick determines what advertisements that person will be most responsive to , and these ads are then downloaded with the web- site the person is accessing .

As of the end of \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739 , DoubleClick had amassed \uf738\uf730 million customer pro\ufb01les.61 Another information collection device , known as a \u201c web bug , \u201d is embedded into a web page or even an email message . The web bug is a hidden snippet of code that can gather data about a person.62 For example , a company can send a spam email with a web bug that will report back when the message is opened . The bug can also record when the message is forwarded to others . Web bugs also can collect information about people as they explore a website . Some of the nas- tier versions of web bugs can even access a person \u2019 s computer \ufb01les.63 Companies also use what has become known as \u201c spyware , \u201d which is software that is often deceptively and secretly installed into peo- ple \u2019 s computers . Spyware can gather information about every move one makes when sur\ufb01ng the Internet . This data is then used by spy- ware companies to target pop-up ads and other forms of advertising.64 Legal scholar Julie Cohen has noted another growing threat to pri- vacy\u2014technologies of digital rights management ( DRM ) , which are used by copyright holders to prevent piracy . Some DRM technologies gather information about individuals as they listen to music , watch videos , or read e-books . DRM technologies thus \u201c create records of intellectual exploration , one of the most personal and private of ac- tivities. \u201d 65 Copyright holders are also using computer programs called \u201c bots \u201d ( shorthand for \u201c robots \u201d ) . Also known as \u201c crawlers \u201d or \u201c spiders , \u201d bots can automatically prowl around the Internet looking for information . Industry trade groups , such as the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and the Motion Picture Association of America \u25b2 t h e r i s e o f t h e d i g i t a l d o s s i e r ( MPAA ) , have unleashed tens of thousands of bots to identify poten- tial illegal users of copyrighted materials.66 Spammers\u2014the senders of junk email\u2014also employ a legion of bots to copy down email ad- dresses that appear on the web in order to add them to spam lists .

Indeed , almost everything on the Internet is being archived . One company has even been sys- tematically sweeping up all the data from the Internet and storing it in a vast electronic warehouse.69 Our online personas\u2014captured , for instance , in our web pages and online postings\u2014are swept up as well . We are accustomed to information on the web quickly \ufb02ickering in and out of existence , presenting the illusion that it is ephemeral . But little on the Internet disappears or is forgotten , even when we delete or change the information . The amount of personal information archived will only escalate as our lives are increasingly digitized into the electric world of cyberspace . These developments certainly suggest a threat to privacy , but what speci\ufb01cally is the problem ? The way this question is answered has profound implications for the way the law will grapple with the prob- lem in the future . Ka f k a a n d O r w e l l Re c o n c e p t u a l i z i n g I n f o r m a t i o n Pr i v a c y The most widely discussed metaphor in the discourse of information privacy is George Orwell \u2019 s depiction of Big Brother in 1984 . The use of the Big Brother metaphor to understand the database privacy prob- lem is hardly surprising . Big Brother has long been the metaphor of choice to characterize privacy problems , and it has frequently been invoked when discussing police search tactics,1 wiretapping and video surveillance,2 and drug testing.3 It is no surprise , then , that the burgeoning discourse on information privacy has seized upon this metaphor . With regard to computer databases , however , Big Brother is incom- plete as a way to understand the problem . Although the Big Brother metaphor certainly describes particular facets of the problem , it neg- lects many crucial dimensions . This oversight is far from inconse- quential , for the way we conceptualize a problem has important rami\ufb01cations for law and policy . The Importance of Metaphor A metaphor , as legal scholar Steven Winter aptly de\ufb01nes it , \u201c is the imaginative capacity by which we relate one thing to another. \u201d 4 In 27\u25b2 \u25b2 k a f k a a n d o r w e l l their groundbreaking analysis , linguistics professor George Lako\ufb00 and philosopher Mark Johnson observe that"}]}

According to legal philosopher Jack Balkin , \u201c metaphoric models selectively describe a situation , and in so doing help to suppress al- ternative conceptions. \u201d Metaphors do not just distort reality but com- pose it ; the \u201c power [ of metaphors ] stems precisely from their ability to empower understanding by shaping and hence limiting it. \u201d 7 Winter , as well as Lako\ufb00 and Johnson , focus on metaphors embod- ied in our thought processes , pervading the type of language we use.8 The metaphors I speak of are not as deeply ingrained . Metaphors are tools of shared cultural understanding.9 Privacy involves the type of society we are creating , and we often use metaphors to envision di\ufb00- erent possible worlds , ones that we want to live in and ones that we don \u2019 t . Orwell \u2019 s Big Brother is an example of this type of metaphor ; it is a shared cultural narrative , one that people can readily comprehend and react to . Ascribing metaphors is not only a descriptive endeavor but also an act of political theorizing with profound normative implications.10 Ac- cording to Judge Richard Posner , however , \u201c it is a mistake to try to mine works of literature for political or economic signi\ufb01cance \u201d be- cause works of literature are better treated as aesthetic works rather than \u201c as works of moral or political philosophy. \u201d 11 To the contrary , lit- erature supplies the metaphors by which we conceptualize certain problems , and Posner fails to acknowledge the role that metaphor plays in shaping our collective understanding . Metaphors function not to render a precise descriptive representation of the problem ; rather , they capture our concerns over privacy in a way that is palpa- ble , potent , and compelling . Metaphors are instructive not for their realism but for the way they direct our focus to certain social and po- litical phenomena . k a f k a a n d o r w e l l \u25b2 George Orwell \u2019 s Big Brother Orwell \u2019 s Totalitarian World .

This terrifying totalitarian state achieves its control by targeting the private life , employing various techniques of power to eliminate any sense of privacy . Big Brother views solitude as dangerous . Its techniques of power are predominantly methods of surveillance . Big Brother is constantly monitoring and spying ; uniformed patrols linger on street corners ; helicopters hover in the skies , poised to peer into windows . The primary surveillance tool is a device called a \u201c tele- screen \u201d which is installed into each house and apartment . The tele- screen is a bilateral television\u2014individuals can watch it , but it also enables Big Brother to watch them : There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment . How often , or on what system , the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guess- work . It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time . . . . You had to live\u2014did live , from habit that became in- stinct\u2014in the assumption that every sound you made was over- heard , and , except in darkness , every movement scrutinized.14 In 1984 , citizens have no way of discovering if and when they are being watched .

All that is needed , then , is to place a supervisor in a central tower and to shut up in each cell a madman , a patient , a condemned man , a worker or a schoolboy . By the e\ufb00ect of backlighting , one can ob- serve from the tower , standing out precisely against the light , the small captive shadows in the cells of the periphery . They are like so many cages , so many small theatres , in which each actor is alone , perfectly individualized and constantly visible.18 The Panopticon is a device of discipline ; its goal is to ensure order , to prevent plots and riots , to mandate total obedience . The Panopti- con achieves its power through an ingenious technique of surveil- lance , one that is ruthlessly e\ufb03cient . By setting up a central observation tower from which all prisoners can be observed and by concealing from them any indication of whether they are being watched at any given time , \u201c surveillance is permanent in its e\ufb00ects , even if it is discontinuous in its action. \u201d 19 Instead of having hundreds of patrols and watchpersons , only a few people need to be in the tower .

By always being visible , by constantly living under the reality that one could be observed at any time , people assimilate the e\ufb00ects of surveillance into themselves . They obey not because they are mon- itored but because of their fear that they could be watched . This fear alone is su\ufb03cient to achieve control . The Panopticon is so e\ufb03cient that nobody needs to be in the tower at all . As Foucault observed , the Panopticon is not merely limited to the prison or to a speci\ufb01c architectural structure\u2014it is a technology of power that can be used in many contexts and in a multitude of ways . In 1984 , the telescreen works in a similar way to the Panopticon , serv- ing as a form of one-way surveillance that structures the behavior of those who are observed . The collection of information in cyberspace can be readily analogized to the telescreen .

Big Brother dominates the discourse of information privacy . In \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf734 , when the use of computer databases was in its infancy , U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Douglas observed that we live in an Orwellian age in which the computer has become \u201c the heart of a surveillance system that will turn society into a trans- parent world. \u201d 20 One state supreme court justice observed that the \u201c acres of \ufb01les \u201d being assembled about us are leading to an \u201c Orwellian society. \u201d 21 Academics similarly characterize the problem.22 In The Culture of Surveillance , sociologist William Staples observes that we have inter- nalized Big Brother\u2014we have created a Big Brother culture , where we all act as agents of surveillance and voyeurism.23 \u201c The specter of Big Brother has haunted computerization from the beginning , \u201d computer science professor Abbe Mowshowitz observes . \u201c Computerized per- sonal record-keeping systems , in the hands of police and intelligence agencies , clearly extend the surveillance capabilities of the state. \u201d 24 \u25b2 k a f k a a n d o r w e l l Commentators have adapted the Big Brother metaphor to describe the threat to privacy caused by private-sector databases , often refer- ring to businesses as \u201c Little Brothers. \u201d 25 As sociologist David Lyon puts it : \u201c Orwell \u2019 s dystopic vision was dominated by the central state . He never guessed just how signi\ufb01cant a decentralized consumerism might become for social control. \u201d 26 Legal scholar Katrin Byford writes : \u201c Life in cyberspace , if left unregulated , thus promises to have distinct Orwellian overtones\u2014with the notable di\ufb00erence that the primary threat to privacy comes not from government , but rather from the corporate world. \u201d 27 In The End of Privacy , political scientist Reg Whitaker also revises the Big Brother narrative into one of a multitude of Little Brothers.28 Internet \u201c surveillance \u201d can be readily compared to Orwell \u2019 s tele- screen . While people surf the web , companies are gathering informa- tion about them .

David Flaherty , who served as the \ufb01rst Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia , explains that the \u201c storage of personal data can be used to limit opportunity and to encourage conformity. \u201d Dossiers of personal information \u201c can have a limiting e\ufb00ect on behavior. \u201d 30 Oscar Gandy , a noted professor of communications and media studies , writes that \u201c panopticism serves as a powerful metaphorical resource for representing the contemporary technology of segmentation and targeting. \u201d 31 As legal scholar Jerry Kang observes : [ D ] ata collection in cyberspace produces data that are detailed , computer-processable , indexed to the individual , and perma- k a f k a a n d o r w e l l \u25b2 nent . Combine this with the fact that cyberspace makes data col- lection and analysis exponentially cheaper than in real space , and we have what Roger Clarke has identi\ufb01ed as the genuine threat of \u201c dataveillance. \u201d 32 Dataveillance , as information technology expert Roger Clarke de\ufb01nes it , refers to the \u201c systematic use of personal data systems in the investi- gation or monitoring of the actions or communications of one or more persons. \u201d 33 According to political scientist Colin Bennet , \u201c [ t ] he term dataveillance has been coined to describe the surveillance prac- tices that the massive collection and storage of vast quantities of per- sonal data have facilitated. \u201d 34 Dataveillance is thus a new form of surveillance , a method of watching not through the eye or the cam- era , but by collecting facts and data . Kang argues that surveillance is an attack on human dignity , interfering with free choice because it \u201c leads to self-censorship. \u201d 35 Likewise , Paul Schwartz claims that data collection \u201c creates a potential for suppressing a capacity for free choice : the more that is known about an individual , the easier it is to force his obedience. \u201d 36 According to this view , the problem with data- bases is that they are a form of surveillance that curtails individual freedom . The Limits of the Metaphor . Despite the fact that the discourse appro- priately conceptualizes privacy through metaphor and that the Big Brother metaphor has proven quite useful for a number of privacy problems , the metaphor has signi\ufb01cant limitations for the database privacy problem . As illustrated by the history of record-keeping and databases in chapter \uf732 , developments in record-keeping were not or- chestrated according to a grand scheme but were largely ad hoc , aris- ing as technology interacted with the demands of the growing public and private bureaucracies . Additionally , the goals of data collection have often been rather benign\u2014or at least far less malignant than the aims of Big"}]}

The story of record-keeping and database production is , in the end , not a story about the progres- sion toward a world ruled by Big Brother or a multitude of Little \u25b2 k a f k a a n d o r w e l l Brothers . Instead , it is a story about a group of di\ufb00erent actors with di\ufb00erent purposes attempting to thrive in an increasingly informa- tion-based society . The most signi\ufb01cant shortcoming of the Big Brother metaphor is that it fails to focus on the appropriate form of power . The metaphor depicts a particular technique of power\u2014surveillance . Certainly , monitoring is an aspect of information collection , and databases may eventually be used in ways that resemble the disciplinary regime of Big Brother . However , most of the existing practices associated with databases are quite di\ufb00erent in character . Direct marketers wish to observe behavior so they can tailor goods and advertisements to indi- vidual di\ufb00erences . True , they desire consumers to act in a certain way ( to purchase their product ) , but their limited attempts at control are far from the repressive regime of total control exercised by Big Brother . The goal of much data collection by marketers aims not at suppressing individuality but at studying it and exploiting it . The most insidious aspect of the surveillance of Big Brother is missing in the context of databases : human judgment about the ac- tivities being observed ( or the fear of that judgment ) . Surveillance leads to conformity , inhibition , and self-censorship in situations where it is likely to involve human judgment . Being observed by an insect on the wall is not invasive of privacy ; rather , privacy is threat- ened by being subject to human observation , which involves judg- ments that can a\ufb00ect one \u2019 s life and reputation . Since marketers generally are interested in aggregate data , they do not care about snooping into particular people \u2019 s private lives . Much personal infor- mation is amassed and processed by computers ; we are being watched not by other humans , but by machines , which gather in- formation , compute pro\ufb01les , and generate lists for mailing , email- ing , or calling . This impersonality makes the surveillance less invasive . While having one \u2019 s actions monitored by computers does not in- volve immediate perception by a human consciousness , it still ex- poses people to the possibility of future review and disclosure . In the context of databases , however , this possibility is remote . Even when such data is used for marketing , marketers merely want to make a pro\ufb01t , not uproot a life or soil a reputation . k a f k a a n d o r w e l"}]}

Although the purposes of the users of personal data are generally not malignant , databases can still result in unintended harmful social e\ufb00ects . The mere knowledge that one \u2019 s behavior is being monitored and recorded certainly can lead to self-censorship and inhibition . Foucault \u2019 s analysis of surveillance points to a more subtle yet more pervasive e\ufb00ect : surveillance changes the entire landscape in which people act , leading toward an internalization of social norms that soon is not even perceived as re- pressive.37 This view of the e\ufb00ects of surveillance raises important questions regarding the amount of normalization that is desirable in society . While our instincts may be to view all normalization as an in- sidious force , most theories of the good depend upon a signi\ufb01cant degree of normalization to hold society together . Although the e\ufb00ects of surveillance are certainly a part of the data- base problem , the heavy focus on surveillance miscomprehends the most central and pernicious e\ufb00ects of databases . Understanding the problem as surveillance fails to account for the majority of our activi- ties in the world and web . A large portion of our personal information involves facts that we are not embarrassed about : our \ufb01nancial infor- mation , race , marital status , hobbies , occupation , and the like . Most people surf the web without wandering into its dark corners . The vast majority of the information collected about us concerns relatively in- nocuous details . The surveillance model does not explain why the recording of this non-taboo information poses a problem . The focus of the surveillance model is on the fringes\u2014and often involves things we may indeed want to inhibit such as cult activity , terrorism , and child pornography . Digital dossiers do cause a serious problem that is overlooked by the Big Brother metaphor , one that poses a threat not just to our free- dom to explore the taboo , but to freedom in general . It is a problem that implicates the type of society we are becoming , the way we think , our place in the larger social order , and our ability to exercise mean- ingful control over our lives . \u25b2 k a f k a a n d o r w e l l Franz Kafka \u2019 s Trial Kafka \u2019 s Distopic Vision .

The Trial is in part a satire , and what is important for the purposes of my argument are the insights the novel provides about society through its exaggerations .

At any time , something could happen to Joseph K. ; decisions are made based on his data , and Joseph K. has no say , no knowledge , and no ability to \ufb01ght back . He is completely at the mercy of the bureaucratic process . As understood in light of the Kafka metaphor , the primary problem with databases stems from the way the bureaucratic process treats in- dividuals and their information . Bureaucracy . Generally , the term \u201c bureaucracy \u201d refers to large public and private organizations with hierarchical structures and a set of elaborate rules , routines , and processes.44 I will use the term to refer not to speci\ufb01c institutions but to a particular set of practices\u2014 speci\ufb01cally , how bureaucratic processes a\ufb00ect and in\ufb02uence individ- uals subjected to them . Bureaucratic organization , sociologist Max Weber asserts , consists of a hierarchical chain-of-command , special- ized o\ufb03ces to carry out particular functions , and a system of general rules to manage the organization.45 Bureaucracy is not limited to gov- ernment administration ; it is also a feature of business management . The modern world requires the e\ufb03cient \ufb02ow of information in order to communicate , to deliver goods and services , to regulate , and to carry out basic functions . According to Weber , bureaucracy is \u201c capa- ble of attaining the highest degree of e\ufb03ciency and is in this sense formally the most rational known means of exercising authority over human beings. \u201d 46 Bureaucratic processes are highly routinized , striv- ing for increased e\ufb03ciency , standardization of decisions , and the cul- tivation of specialization and expertise . As Paul Schwartz notes , k a f k a a n d o r w e l l \u25b2 bureaucracy depends upon \u201c vast quantities of information \u201d that \u201c re- lates to identi\ufb01able individuals. \u201d 47 Much of this information is impor- tant and necessary to the smooth functioning of bureaucracies . Although bureaucratic organization is an essential and bene\ufb01cial feature of modern society , bureaucracy also presents numerous prob- lems . Weber observes that bureaucracy can become \u201c dehumanized \u201d by striving to eliminate \u201c love , hatred , and all purely personal , irra- tional , and emotional elements which escape calculation. \u201d 48 Bureau- cracy often can not adequately attend to the needs of particular individuals\u2014not because bureaucrats are malicious , but because they must act within strict time constraints , have limited training , and are frequently not able to respond to unusual situations in unique or creative ways . Schwartz contends that because bureau- cracy does not adequately protect the dignity of the people it deals with , it can \u201c weaken an individual \u2019 s capacity for critical re\ufb02ection and participation in society. \u201d 49 Additionally , decisions within public and private bureaucratic organizations are often hidden from public view , decreasing accountability .

At lower levels , discretion can enable abuses . Frequently , bureaucracies fail to train employees adequately and may employ subpar security measures over personal data . Bureaucracies are often careless in their uses and handling of personal information . The problem with databases emerges from subjecting personal in- formation to the bureaucratic process with little intelligent control or limitation , which results in our not having meaningful participation in decisions about our information . Bureaucratic decision-making processes are being exercised ever more frequently over a greater sphere of our lives , and we have little power or say within such a sys- tem , which tends to structure our participation along standardized ways that fail to enable us to achieve our goals , wants , and needs . Bureaucracy and Power . The power e\ufb00ects of this relationship to bu- reaucracy are profound ; however , they can not adequately be ex- plained by resorting only to the understanding of power in Orwell \u2019 s \u25b2 k a f k a a n d o r w e l l 1984 . Big Brother employs a coercive power that is designed to domi- nate and oppress . Power , however , is not merely prohibitive ; as illus- trated by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World , it composes our very lives and culture . Huxley describes a di\ufb00erent form of totalitarian so- ciety\u2014one controlled not by force , but by entertainment and pleas- ure . The population is addicted to a drug called Soma , which is administered by the government as a political tool to sedate the peo- ple . Huxley presents a narrative about a society controlled not by a despotic coercive government like Big Brother , but by manipulation and consumption , where people participate in their own enslave- ment . The government achieves obedience through social condition- ing , propaganda , and other forms of indoctrination.51 It does not use the crude coercive techniques of violence and force , but instead em- ploys a more subtle scienti\ufb01c method of control\u2014through genetic en- gineering , psychology , and drugs . Power works internally\u2014the government actively molds the private life of its citizens , transform- ing it into a world of vapid pleasure , mindlessness , and numbness . Despite the di\ufb00erences , power for both Orwell and Huxley oper- ates as an insidious force employed for a particular design . The Trial depicts a di\ufb00erent form of power . The power employed in The Trial has no apparent goal ; any purpose remains shrouded in mystery . Nor is the power as direct and manipulative in design as that depicted by Orwell and Huxley . The Court system barely even cares about Joseph K. The Trial depicts a world that di\ufb00ers"}]}

One frightening implication is that there was no reason , or if there were , it was absurd or arbitrary . Joseph K. was subjected to a more purposeless process than a trial .

The power depicted k a f k a a n d o r w e l l \u25b2 in The Trial is not so much a force as it is an element of relationships between individuals and society and government .

Under this view , the problem with databases and the practices cur- rently associated with them is that they disempower people . They make people vulnerable by stripping them of control over their per- sonal information . There is no diabolical motive or secret plan for domination ; rather , there is a web of thoughtless decisions made by low-level bureaucrats , standardized policies , rigid routines , and a way of relating to individuals and their information that often becomes indi\ufb00erent to their welfare . The Interplay of the Metaphors . The Kafka and Orwell metaphors are not mutually exclusive . As I will discuss in more depth in part III of this book , the interplay of the metaphors captures the problems with government access to digital dossiers . In particular , the government is increasingly mining data from private-sector sources to pro\ufb01le indi- viduals . Information about people is observed or recorded and then fed into computer programs that analyze the data looking for certain behavior patterns common to criminal or terrorist activity .

Being watched and inhibited in one \u2019 s behavior is only one part of the problem ; the other dimension is that the data is warehoused for unknown future uses . This is where Orwell meets Kafka . Beyond the Secrecy Paradigm Understanding the database privacy problem in terms of the Kafka metaphor illustrates that the problem with databases concerns the use of information , not merely keeping it secret . Traditionally , privacy problems have been understood as invasions into one \u2019 s hidden world . Privacy is about concealment , and it is invaded by watching and by public disclosure of con\ufb01dential information .

Few would be embarrassed by the disclosure of much of the material they read , the food they eat , or the products they purchase . Few would view their race , ethnicity , marital status , or religion as con\ufb01dential . Of course , databases may contain the residue of scandals and skeletons\u2014illicit websites , racy books , stigmatizing diseases\u2014but since information in databases is rarely publicized , few reputations are tarnished . For the most part , the data is processed impersonally by computers without ever being viewed by the human eye . The secrecy paradigm focuses on breached con\ufb01dentiality , harmed reputation , and unwanted pub- licity . But since these harms are not really the central problems of databases , privacy law often concludes that the information in data- bases is not private and is thus not entitled to protection . Indeed , one commentator defended DoubleClick \u2019 s tracking of web browsing habits by stating : Over time , people will realize it \u2019 s not Big Brother who \u2019 s going to show up [ at ] your door in a black ski mask and take your kids away or dig deep into your medical history . This is a situation where you are essentially dropped into a bucket with \uf734\uf730 million people who look and feel a lot like you do to the advertising com- pany.54 This commentator , viewing privacy with the Big Brother metaphor , focuses on the wrong types of harms and implicitly views only secret information as private . The problem with databases pertains to the uses and practices as- sociated with our information , not merely whether that information remains completely secret . Although disclosure can be a violation of privacy , this does not mean that avoiding disclosure is the sum and substance of our interest in privacy . What people want when they de- mand privacy with regard to their personal information is the ability to ensure that the information about them will be used only for the purposes they desire . Even regarding the con\ufb01dentiality of informa- tion , the understanding of privacy as secrecy fails to recognize that individuals want to keep things private from some people but not \u25b2 k a f k a a n d o r w e l l others . The fact that an employee criticizes her boss to a co-worker does not mean that she wants her boss to know what she said . Helen Nissenbaum , a professor of information technology , is quite right to argue that we often expect privacy even when in public.55 Not all activities are purely private in the sense that they occur in isolation and in hidden corners . When we talk in a restaurant , we do not expect to be listened to . A person may buy condoms or hemorrhoid medica- tion in a store open"}]}

Contrary to the notion that any information in public records can not be private , there is a consider- able loss of privacy by plucking inaccessible facts buried in some ob- scure document and broadcasting them to the world on the evening news . Privacy can be infringed even if no secrets are revealed and even if nobody is watching us . The Aggregation Effect The digital revolution has enabled information to be easily amassed and combined . Even information that is super\ufb01cial or incomplete can be quite useful in obtaining more data about individuals . Information breeds information . For example , although one \u2019 s SSN does not in and of itself reveal much about an individual , it provides access to one \u2019 s \ufb01nancial information , educational records , medical records , and a whole host of other information . As law professor Julie Cohen notes , \u201c [ a ] comprehensive collection of data about an individual is vastly more than the sum of its parts. \u201d 56 I refer to this phenomenon as the \u201c aggregation e\ufb00ect. \u201d Similar to a Seurat painting , where a multitude of dots juxtaposed together form a picture , bits of information when aggregated paint a portrait of a person . In the Information Age , personal data is being combined to create a digital biography about us . Information that appears innocuous can sometimes be the missing link , the critical detail in one \u2019 s digital biog- raphy , or the key necessary to unlock other stores of personal infor- mation . But why should we be concerned about a biography that includes details about what type of soap a person buys , whether she prefers Pepsi to Coca-Cola , or whether she likes to shop at Macy \u2019 s rather than Kmart ? As legal scholar Stan Karas points out , the prod- k a f k a a n d o r w e l l \u25b2 ucts we consume are expressive of our identities.57 We have many choices in the products we buy , and even particular brands symbolize certain personality traits and personal characteristics . Karas notes that Pepsi has marketed itself to a younger , more rebellious consumer than Coca-Cola , which emphasizes old-fashioned and traditional im- ages in its advertisements.58 Whether punk , yuppie , or hippie , people often follow a particular consumption pattern that re\ufb02ects the sub- culture with which they identify.59 Of course , the products we buy are not wholly re\ufb02ective of our identities . A scene from Henry James \u2019 s Portrait of a Lady best captures the complexities of the situation . Madame Merle , wise in the ways of the world yet jaded and sel\ufb01sh , is speaking to Isabel Archer , a young American lady in Europe full of great aspirations of living a bold and exceptional"}]}

Where does it begin ? Where does it end ? It over\ufb02ows into everything that belongs to us\u2014and then it \ufb02ows back again . I know a large part of myself is the clothes I choose to wear . I \u2019 ve a great respect for things ! \u201d Isabel disagrees : \u201c nothing that belongs to me is any measure of me. \u201d \u201c My clothes only express the dressmaker , \u201d Isabel says , \u201c but they don \u2019 t express me . To begin with , it is not my own choice that I wear them ; they \u2019 ve been imposed upon me by society. \u201d 60 Merle is obsessed by things , and she views herself as deeply inter- twined with her possessions . The objects she owns and purchases are deeply constitutive of her personality . Isabel , in her proud individual- ism , claims that she is vastly distinct from what she owns and wears . Indeed , for her , things are a tool for conformity ; they do not express anything authentic about herself . Yet Madame Merle has a point\u2014the information is indeed expres- sive . But Isabel is right , too\u2014this information is somewhat super\ufb01- cial , and it only partially captures who we are . Although the digital biography contains a host of details about a person , it captures a dis- torted persona , one who is constructed by a variety of external de- tails.61 Although the information marketers glean about us can be quite revealing , it still can not penetrate into our thoughts and often only partially captures who we are.62 Information about our property , our professions , our purchases , our \ufb01nances , and our medical history does not tell the whole story . We are more than the bits of data we give \u25b2 k a f k a a n d o r w e l l o\ufb00 as we go about our lives . Our digital biography is revealing of our- selves but in a rather standardized way . It consists of bits of informa- tion pre-de\ufb01ned based on the judgment of some entity about what categories of information are relevant or important . We are partially captured by details such as our age , race , gender , net worth , property owned , and so on , but only in a manner that standardizes us into types or categories . Indeed , database marketers frequently classify consumers into certain categories based on stereotypes about their values , lifestyle , and purchasing habits . As Julie Cohen observes , peo- ple are not simply \u201c reducible to the sum of their transactions , genetic markers , and other measurable attributes. \u201d 63 Our digital biography is thus an unauthorized one , only partially true and very reductive .

Although a more extensive dossier might be less reductive in capturing our personalities , it would have greater controlling e\ufb00ects on an individual \u2019 s life . Not only are our digital biographies reductive , but they are often inaccurate . In today \u2019 s bureaucratized world , one of the growing threats is that we will be subject to the inadvertence , carelessness , and mindlessness of bureaucracy . A scene from the darkly humorous movie Brazil illustrates this problem.64 The movie opens with an ex- hausted bureaucrat swatting a \ufb02y , which inconspicuously drops into a typewriter , causes a jam , and results in him mistyping a letter in a person \u2019 s name on a form . The form authorizes the arrest and interro- gation of suspected rebels . In the next scene , an innocent man peace- fully sits in his home with his family when suddenly scores of armor-clad police storm inside and haul him away . These dangers are not merely the imaginary stu\ufb00 of movies . The burgeoning use of databases of public record information by the pri- vate sector in screening job applicants and investigating existing em- ployees demonstrates how errors can potentially destroy a person \u2019 s career . For example , a Maryland woman wrongly arrested for a bur- glary was not cleared from the state \u2019 s criminal databases . Her name and SSN also migrated to a Baltimore County database relating to child protective services cases . She was \ufb01red from her job as a substi- tute teacher , and only after she could establish that the information k a f k a a n d o r w e l l \u25b2 was in error was she rehired . When she later left that job to run a day care center for the U.S. military , she was subjected to questioning about the erroneous arrest . Later on , when employed at as a child care director at a YMCA , she was terminated when her arrest record surfaced in a background clearance check . Since she could not have the error expunged in su\ufb03cient time , the job was given to another person . Only after several years was the error \ufb01nally cleared from the public records.65 As our digital biographies are increasingly relied upon to make important decisions , the problems that errors can cause will only escalate in frequency and magnitude . To the extent that the digital biography is accurate , our lives are not only revealed and recorded , but also can be analyzed and investi- gated . Our digital biographies are being assembled by companies which are amassing personal information in public records along with other data . Collectively , millions of biographies can be searched , sorted , and analyzed in a matter of seconds ."}]}

Increasingly , companies are conduct- ing investigations which can have profound consequences on people \u2019 s lives\u2014such as their employment and \ufb01nancial condition . Employers are resorting to information brokers of public record infor- mation to assist in screening job applicants and existing employees . For example , the \ufb01rm HireCheck serves over \uf734 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 employers to con- duct background checks for new hires or current employees.66 It con- ducts a national search of outstanding arrest warrants ; a SSN search to locate the person \u2019 s age , past and current employers , and former ad- dresses ; a driver record search ; a search of worker \u2019 s compensation claims \u201c to avoid habitual claimants or to properly channel assign- ments \u201d ; a check of civil lawsuit records ; and searches for many other types of information.67 These investigations occur without any exter- nal oversight , and individuals often do not have an opportunity to challenge the results . Forms of Dehumanization : Databases and the Kafka Metaphor Expounding on the Kafka metaphor , certain uses of databases foster a state of powerlessness and vulnerability created by people \u2019 s lack of \u25b2 k a f k a a n d o r w e l l any meaningful form of participation in the collection and use of their personal information . Bureaucracy and power is certainly not a new problem . Databases do not cause the disempowering e\ufb00ects of bureaucracy ; they exacerbate them\u2014not merely by magnifying exist- ing power imbalances but by transforming these relationships in pro- found ways that implicate our freedom . The problem is thus old and new , and its additional dimensions within the Information Age re- quire extensive explication . Impoverished Judgments . One of the great dangers of using information that we generally regard as private is that we often make judgments based on this private information about the person . As legal scholar Kenneth Karst warned in the \uf731\uf739\uf736\uf730s , one danger of \u201c a centralized , stan- dardized data processing system \u201d is that the facts stored about an in- dividual \u201c will become the only signi\ufb01cant facts about the subject of the inquiry. \u201d 68 Legal scholar Je\ufb00rey Rosen aptly observes , \u201c Privacy protects us from being misde\ufb01ned and judged out of context in a world of short attention spans , a world in which information can eas- ily be confused with knowledge . True knowledge of another person is the culmination of a slow process of mutual revelation. \u201d 69 Increased reliance upon the easily quanti\ufb01able and classi\ufb01able in- formation available from databases is having profound social e\ufb00ects .

In the law alone , there is a trend to rank schools ; to measure the in\ufb02uence of fa- mous jurists by counting citations to their judicial opinions ; 70 to as- sess the importance of law review articles by tabulating citations to them ; 71 to rank law journals with an elaborate system of establishing point values for authors of articles ; 72 and to determine the in\ufb02uence of academic movements by checking citations.73 The goal of this use of empirical data is to eliminate the ambiguity and incommensura- bility of many aspects of life and try to categorize them into neat , tidy categories . The computer has exacerbated this tendency , for the in- crease in information and the way computers operate furthers this type of categorization and lack of judgment.74 Indeed , in legal schol- k a f k a a n d o r w e l l \u25b2 arship , much of this tendency is due to the advent of computer re- search databases , which can easily check for citations and speci\ufb01c terms . In our increasingly bureaucratic and impersonal world , we are re- lying more heavily on records and pro\ufb01les to assess reputation . As H. Je\ufb00 Smith , a professor of management and information technology , contends : [ D ] ecisions that were formerly based on judgment and human factors are instead decided according to prescribed formulas . In today \u2019 s world , this response is often characterized by reliance on a rigid , unyielding process in which computerized information is given great weight . Facts that actually require substantial evalua- tion could instead be reduced to discrete entries in preassigned categories.75 Certainly , quanti\ufb01able information can be accurate and serve as the best way for making particular decisions . Even when quanti\ufb01able information is not exact , it is useful for making decisions because of administrative feasibility . Considering all the variables and a multi- tude of incommensurate factors might simply be impossible or too costly . Nevertheless , the information in databases often fails to capture the texture of our lives . Rather than provide a nuanced portrait of our personalities , compilations of data capture the brute facts of what we do without the reasons . For example , a record of an arrest without the story or reason is misleading . The arrest could have been for civil dis- obedience in the \uf731\uf739\uf736\uf730s\u2014but it is still recorded as an arrest with some vague label , such as \u201c disorderly conduct. \u201d It appears no di\ufb00erently from the arrest of a vandal . In short , we are reconstituted in databases as a digital person composed of data . The privacy problem stems par- adoxically from the pervasiveness of this data\u2014the fact that it en- compasses much of our lives\u2014as well as from its limitations\u2014how it fails to capture us , how it distorts who we are .

Privacy concerns an individual \u2019 s power in the elaborate web of social relationships that encompasses \u25b2 k a f k a a n d o r w e l l telephone companies , utility companies , her life . Today , a signi\ufb01cant number of these relationships involve in- teraction with public and private institutions . In addition to the myr- iad of public agencies that regulate the products we purchase , the environment , and the like , we depend upon private institutions such Internet service as providers , cable service providers , and health insurance companies . We also depend upon companies that provide the products we be- lieve are essential to our daily lives : hygiene , transportation , enter- tainment , news , and so on . Our lives are ensconced in these institutions , which have power over our day-to-day activities ( through what we consume , read , and watch ) , our culture , politics , education , and economic well-being . We are engaged in relationships with these institutions , even if on the surface our interactions with them are as rudimentary and distant as signing up for services , pay- ing bills , and requesting repairs . With many \ufb01rms\u2014such as credit re- porting agencies\u2014we do not even take a\ufb03rmative steps to establish a relationship . Companies are beginning to use personal information to identify what business experts call \u201c angel \u201d and \u201c demon \u201d customers.76 Cer- tain customers\u2014the angels\u2014are very pro\ufb01table , but others\u2014the demons\u2014are not . Angel customers account for a large amount of a company \u2019 s business whereas demon customers purchase only a small amount of goods and services and are likely to cost the company money . For example , a demon customer is one who uses up a com- pany \u2019 s resources by frequently calling customer service . Some busi- ness experts thus recommend that companies identify these types of customers through the use of personal information and treat them di\ufb00erently . For example , businesses might serve the angels \ufb01rst and leave the demons waiting ; or they might o\ufb00er the angels cheaper prices ; or perhaps , they might even try to turn the demons away en- tirely.77 The result of companies moving in this direction is that people will be treated di\ufb00erently and may never know why . Even before the concept of angel and demon customers was articulated , one bank routinely denied credit card applications from college students ma- joring in literature , history , and art , based on the assumption that they would not be able to repay their debts . The bank \u2019 s practice re- mained a secret until the media ran a story about it.78 k a f k a a n d o r w e l l \u25b2 We are increasingly not being treated as equals in our relationships with many private-sector institutions .

It involves the ability to avoid the collection and circulation of such powerful information in one \u2019 s life without having any say in the process , without knowing who has what information , what pur- poses or motives those entities have , or what will be done with that information in the future . Privacy involves the power to refuse to be treated with bureaucratic indi\ufb00erence when one complains about er- rors or when one wants certain data expunged . It is not merely the collection of data that is the problem\u2014it is our complete lack of con- trol over the ways it is used or may be used in the future . Problematic Information Gathering Techniques . This powerlessness is compounded by the fact that the process of information collection in America is clandestine , duplicitous , and unfair . The choices given to people over their information are hardly choices at all . People must relinquish personal data to gain employment , procure insurance , ob- tain a credit card , or otherwise participate like a normal citizen in to- day \u2019 s economy . Consent is virtually meaningless in many contexts . When people give consent , they must often consent to a total surren- der of control over their information . Collection of information is often done by misleading the con- sumer . General Electric sent a supposedly anonymous survey to shareholders asking them to rate various aspects of the company . Un- beknownst to those surveyed , the survey \u2019 s return envelope was coded so that the responses could be matched to names in the company \u2019 s shareholder database.80 Some information is directly solicited via registration question- naires or other means such as competitions and sweepstakes . The \u25b2 k a f k a a n d o r w e l l warranty registration cards of many products\u2014which ask a host of lifestyle questions\u2014are often sent not to the company that makes the product but to National Demographics and Lifestyles Company at a Denver post o\ufb03ce box . This company has compiled information on over \uf732\uf730 million people and markets it to other companies.81 Often , there is an implicit misleading notion that consumers must \ufb01ll out a registration questionnaire in order to be covered by the warranty .

Al- most \uf734\uf730\uf730 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 people responded .

Stephen Jacoby , the vice president for marketing and databases , said : \u201c What we \u2019 re trying to do is enhance the relationship between the subscriber and their magazine . In a sense , it \u2019 s a bene\ufb01t to the subscriber. \u201d 84 There is no \u201c conversation \u201d created by supplying the data . Conde Nast does not indicate how the information will be used . It basically tries to entice people to give information for a vague promise of little or no value . While the company insists that it will not share informa- tion with \u201c outsiders , \u201d it does not explain who constitutes an \u201c out- sider. \u201d The information remains in the control of the company , with no limitations on use . Merely informing the consumer that data may be sold to others is an inadequate form of disclosure . The consumer k a f k a a n d o r w e l l \u25b2 does not know how many times the data will be resold , to whom it will be sold , or for what purposes it will be used . Irresponsibility and Carelessness . A person \u2019 s lack of control is exacer- bated by the often thoughtless and irresponsible ways that bureau- cracies use personal information and their lack of accountability in using and protecting the data . In other words , the problem is not sim- ply a lack of individual control over information , but a situation where nobody is exercising meaningful control over the information .

Although prom- ising its users that their information would remain con\ufb01dential , the website GeoCities collected and sold information about children who played games on the site.86 RealNetworks , Inc. secretly collected per- sonal information about its users in direct violation of its privacy pol- icy . And a website for young investors promised that the data it collected about people \u2019 s \ufb01nances would remain anonymous , but in- stead it was kept in identi\ufb01able form.87 More insidious than drifting and reactionary privacy policies are irresponsible and careless uses of personal information . For example , Metromail Corporation , a seller of direct marketing information , hired inmates to enter the information into databases . This came to light when an inmate began sending harassing letters that were sexu- ally explicit and \ufb01lled with intimate details of people \u2019 s lives.88 A televi- sion reporter once paid $ \uf732\uf737\uf737 to obtain from Metromail a list of over \u25b2 k a f k a a n d o r w e l l \uf735 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 children living in Pasadena , California .

T h e Pr o b l e m s o f I n f o r m a t i o n Pr i v a c y L a w A distinctive domain of law relating to information privacy has been developing throughout the twentieth century . Although the law has made great strides in dealing with privacy problems , the law of infor- mation privacy has been severely hampered by the di\ufb03culties in for- mulating a compelling theory of privacy . The story of privacy law is a tale of changing technology and the law \u2019 s struggle to respond in e\ufb00ec- tive ways . Information privacy law consists of a mosaic of various types of law : tort law , constitutional law , federal and state statutory law , evi- dentiary privileges , property law , and contract law . Much of privacy law is interrelated , and as legal scholar Ken Gormley observes , \u201c vari- ous o\ufb00shoots of privacy are deeply intertwined at the roots , owing their origins to the same soil. \u201d 1 Information privacy law has made great strides toward protecting privacy . Nevertheless , there are systematic de\ufb01ciencies across the spectrum of privacy law in addressing the special nature of the prob- lem of digital dossiers . 56 \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w \u25b2 The Privacy Torts Warren and Brandeis . Privacy law owes its greatest debt to Samuel War- ren and Louis Brandeis . Warren and Brandeis practiced law together in a Boston law \ufb01rm . Brandeis later went on to become a Supreme Court justice.2 In \uf731\uf738\uf739\uf730 , they wrote their profoundly in\ufb02uential article , The Right to Privacy,3 considered by many to be one of the primary foundations of privacy law in the United States.4 In the article , Warren and Brandeis raised alarm at the intersection of yellow journalism,5 with its increasing hunger for sensational human interest stories , and the development of new technologies in photography . During the lat- ter half of the nineteenth century , newspapers were the most rapidly growing form of media , with circulation increasing about \uf731 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 per- cent from \uf731\uf738\uf735\uf730 to \uf731\uf738\uf739\uf730 . In \uf731\uf738\uf735\uf730 , there were approximately \uf731\uf730\uf730 newspa- pers with \uf738\uf730\uf730 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 readers . By \uf731\uf738\uf739\uf730 , there were \uf739\uf730\uf730 papers with over \uf738 million readers . This massive growth was due , in part , to yellow jour- nalism , a form of sensationalistic reporting that focused on scandals and petty crimes . Reaping the successes of yellow journalism , Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst became the barons"}]}

According to Warren and Brandeis : \u201c The press is overstepping in every direction the obvious bounds of propriety and decency . Gossip is no longer the resource of the idle and of the vi- cious , but has become a trade , which is pursued with industry as well as e\ufb00rontery. \u201d 6 Warren and Brandeis also expressed concern over what they called \u201c instantaneous \u201d photography . Although photography had been around before \uf731\uf738\uf739\uf730 , recent developments made photography much cheaper and easier . Cameras had been large , expensive , and not read- ily portable . In \uf731\uf738\uf738\uf734 , the Eastman Kodak Company came out with the \u201c snap camera , \u201d a hand-held camera for the general public . For the \ufb01rst time , people could take candid photographs . Warren and Bran- deis feared the intersection of this new photographic technology with the gossip-hungry press : \u201c Instantaneous photographs and newspa- per enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and do- mestic life ; and numerous mechanical devices threaten to make good the prediction that \u2018 what is whispered in the closet shall be pro- claimed from the house-tops. \u2019 \u201d 7 \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w On the surface , observed Warren and Brandeis , the existing com- mon law failed to a\ufb00ord a remedy for privacy invasions . But it con- tained the seeds to develop the proper protection of privacy . The authors looked to existing legal rights and concluded that they were manifestations of a deeper principle lodged in the common law\u2014 \u201c the more general right of the individual to be let alone. \u201d 8 From this principle , new remedies to protect privacy could be derived . Warren and Brandeis suggested that the primary way to safeguard privacy was through tort actions to allow people to sue others for privacy in- vasions . What Warren and Brandeis achieved was nothing short of magni\ufb01- cent . By pulling together various isolated strands of the common law , the authors demonstrated that creating remedies for privacy inva- sions wouldn \u2019 t radically change the law but would merely be an ex- pansion of what was already germinating . As early as \uf731\uf739\uf730\uf733 , courts and legislatures responded to the Warren and Brandeis article by creating a number of privacy torts to redress the harms that Warren and Brandeis had noted.9 These torts permit people to sue others for privacy violations . In \uf731\uf739\uf736\uf730 , William Prosser , one of the most renowned experts on tort law , surveyed over \uf733\uf730\uf730 pri- vacy cases in the \uf737\uf730 years since the publication of the Warren and Brandeis article.10 He concluded that the cases could be classi\ufb01ed as involving four distinct torts.11 These torts are : ( \uf731"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ") intrusion upon seclu- sion ; ( \uf732 ) public disclosure of private facts ; ( \uf733 ) false light ; and ( \uf734 ) ap- propriation . Today , whether by statute or common law , most states recognize some or all of the privacy torts.12 The privacy torts emerged in response to the privacy problems raised by Warren and Brandeis\u2014namely , the incursions into privacy by the burgeoning print media . Today , we are experiencing the rapid rise of a new form of media\u2014the Internet . Although the press still poses a threat to privacy , and photography has become an indispen- sable tool of journalism ( as Warren and Brandeis accurately pre- dicted ) , there are now many additional threats to privacy other than the press . The privacy torts are capable of redressing speci\ufb01c harms done to individuals\u2014such as when the press discloses a deeply em- barrassing secret about a private \ufb01gure\u2014but are not well adapted to t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w \u25b2 regulating the \ufb02ow of personal information in computer databases and cyberspace . Intrusion upon Seclusion . The tort of intrusion upon seclusion protects against the intentional intrusion into one \u2019 s \u201c solitude or seclusion \u201d or \u201c private a\ufb00airs or concerns \u201d that \u201c would be highly o\ufb00ensive to a rea- sonable person. \u201d 13 Although this tort could be applied to the informa- tion collection techniques of databases , most of the information collection is not \u201c highly o\ufb00ensive to a reasonable person. \u201d Each par- ticular instance of collection is often small and innocuous ; the danger is created by the aggregation of information , a state of a\ufb00airs typically created by hundreds of actors over a long period of time . Indeed , courts have thrown out cases for intrusion involving the type of infor- mation that would likely be collected in databases . For example , courts have rejected intrusion actions based on obtaining a person \u2019 s unlisted phone number , selling the names of magazine subscribers to direct mail companies , and collecting and disclosing an individual \u2019 s past insurance history.14 Further , intrusion must involve an invasion of \u201c seclusion , \u201d and courts have dismissed intrusion suits when plain- ti\ufb00s have been in public places . With regard to databases , much infor- mation collection and use occurs in public , and indeed , many parts of cyberspace may well be considered public places . Therefore , the tort of intrusion can not provide an adequate safeguard against the gathering of personal information for databases . Public Disclosure of Private Facts . The tort of public disclosure of private facts creates a cause of action when one makes public \u201c a matter con- cerning the private life of another \u201d in a"}]}

In contrast , databases of personal information are often transferred between speci\ufb01c companies , not broadcast on the evening news . Even if marketers disclosed information widely to the public , the tort is limited to \u201c highly o\ufb00ensive \u201d facts , and most facts in databases would not be highly o\ufb00ensive if made public . Moreover , some marketing data may already be in a public record , or by furnish- ing data in the \ufb01rst place , an individual may be deemed to have as- sented to its dissemination . Additionally , the disclosure of personal information through the use and sale of databases is often done in secret . The trade in infor- mation is done behind closed doors in a kind of underworld that most people know little about . This secret trading of data is often completely legal . Thus , it would be di\ufb03cult for a plainti\ufb00 to discover that such sales or disclosures have been made . Even if people are gen- erally aware that their data is being transferred , they will often not be able to \ufb01nd out the speci\ufb01cs\u2014what companies are receiving it and what these companies plan to do with it . As a result , the public disclo- sure tort is not well-adapted to combating the \ufb02ow of personal infor- mation between various companies . False Light . The tort of false light is primarily a variation on the defamation torts of libel and slander , protecting against the giving of \u201c publicity to a matter concerning another that places the other before the public in a false light \u201d that is \u201c highly o\ufb00ensive to a reasonable per- son. \u201d 17 Like defamation , this tort has limited applicability to the types of privacy harms created by the collection and use of personal infor- mation by way of computer databases . Both defamation and false light protect one"}]}

Appropriation . The tort of appropriation occurs when one \u201c appropri- ates to his own use or bene\ufb01t the name or likeness of another. \u201d 18 In the courts , this tort has developed into a form of intellectual property right in aspects of one \u2019 s personhood . The interest protected is the in- t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w \u25b2 dividual \u2019 s right to \u201c the exclusive use of his own identity , in so far as it is represented by his name or likeness. \u201d 19 For example , people can sue under this tort when their names or images are used to promote a product without their consent.20 Appropriation could be applied to database marketing , which can be viewed as the use of personal information for pro\ufb01t . However , the tort \u2019 s focus on protecting the commercial value of personal informa- tion has often prevented it from being an e\ufb00ective tool in grappling with the database privacy problem . In Dwyer v. American Express Co. , a court held there was no appropriation when American Express sold its cardholders \u2019 names to merchants because \u201c an individual name has value only when it is associated with one of defendants \u2019 lists . Defen- dants create value by categorizing and aggregating these names . Fur- thermore , defendants \u2019 practices do not deprive any of the cardholders of any value their individual names may possess. \u201d 21 In Shibley v. Time , Inc. , a court held that there was no action for appro- priation when magazines sold subscription lists to direct mail com- panies because the plainti\ufb00 was not being used to endorse any product.22 The appropriation tort often aims at protecting one \u2019 s eco- nomic interest in a form of property , and it is most e\ufb00ective at pro- tecting celebrities who have created value in their personalities . This is not the same interest involved with privacy , which can be impli- cated regardless of the economic value accorded to one \u2019 s name or likeness . An Overarching Problem . Even if it were possible to eliminate the above di\ufb03culties with some minor adjustments to the privacy torts , the pri- vacy problem with databases transcends the speci\ufb01c injuries and harms that the privacy torts are designed to redress . By its nature , tort law looks to isolated acts , to particular infringements and wrongs . The problem with databases does not stem from any speci\ufb01c act , but is a systemic issue of power caused by the combination of relatively small actions , each of which when viewed in isolation would appear quite innocuous .

There is often no single wrongdoer ; responsibility is spread among a multitude of actors , with a vast array of motives and aims , each doing \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w di\ufb00erent things at di\ufb00erent times . For example , when a person un- wittingly \ufb01nds herself embroiled in a public news story , the invasive- ness of the media is often not the product of one particular reporter . Rather , the collective actions of numerous reporters camping outside a person \u2019 s home and following her wherever she goes severely dis- rupt her life . The di\ufb03culty in obtaining a legal remedy for this dis- ruption is that no one reporter \u2019 s actions may be all that invasive or objectionable . The harm is created by the totality of privacy inva- sions , but the tort of intrusion upon seclusion only focuses on each particular actor.23 In sum , tort law often views privacy invasions separately and indi- vidually ; but the problems of digital dossiers emerge from the collec- tive e\ufb00ects of information transactions , combinations , lapses in security , disclosures , and abusive uses . Therefore , solutions involving the retooling of tort law will be severely limited in redressing the problem . Constitutional Law The U.S. Constitution protects privacy in a number of ways even though the word \u201c privacy \u201d does not appear in the document . Al- though the Constitution does not explicitly provide for a right to pri- vacy , a number of its provisions protect certain dimensions of privacy , and the Supreme Court has sculpted a right to privacy by molding to- gether a variety of constitutional protections . Beyond the U.S. Consti- tution , many states protect privacy in their own constitutions\u2014some with an explicit right to privacy.24 The U.S. Constitution only protects against state action , and many databases belong to the private sector . However , since the govern- ment is often a supplier of information to the private sector and is a major source of databases , constitutional protection could serve as a good potential tool for grappling with the problem . The First Amendment . In addition to protecting free speech , the First Amendment safeguards the right of people to associate with one an- other . Freedom of association restricts the government \u2019 s ability to de- mand organizations to disclose the names and addresses of their t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w \u25b2 members or to compel people to list the organizations to"}]}

The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the First Amendment protects anonymous speech , and it can restrict the government from requiring the disclosure of informa- tion that reveals a speaker \u2019 s identity.27 However , the First Amendment only applies when the government plays a role in the compulsion of the information,28 and most of the gathering of personal information by companies isn \u2019 t done under the pressure of any law . The Fourth and Fifth Amendments . The Fourth Amendment restricts the government from conducting \u201c unreasonable searches and seizures. \u201d 29 It typically requires that government o\ufb03cials \ufb01rst obtain judicial au- thorization before conducting a search . According to the Supreme Court , \u201c [ t ] he overriding function of the Fourth Amendment is to pro- tect personal privacy and dignity against unwarranted intrusion by the State. \u201d 30 The Fifth Amendment provides for a privilege against self-incrimination.31 The government can not compel individuals to disclose incriminating information about themselves . In \uf731\uf738\uf738\uf736 , the Court articulated how the Fourth and Fifth Amendments worked in tandem to protect privacy . The case was Boyd v. United States.32 The government sought to compel a merchant to produce documents for use in a civil forfeiture proceeding . The Court held that the govern- ment could not require the disclosure of the documents because \u201c any forcible and compulsory extortion of a man \u2019 s own testimony or of his private papers to be used as evidence to convict him of crime or to forfeit his goods \u201d is an \u201c invasion of his indefeasible right to personal security , personal liberty and private property. \u201d 33 As the administrative state blossomed throughout the twentieth century , the Court sidestepped the broad implications of Boyd . The administrative state spawned hundreds of agencies and a vast \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w bureaucracy that maintained records of personal information . As William Stuntz notes , \u201c [ g ] overnment regulation required lots of infor- mation , and Boyd came dangerously close to giving regulated actors a blanket entitlement to nondisclosure .

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "a regime. \u201d 34 Therefore , the Court abandoned Boyd , and it increasingly curtailed the Fourth and Fifth Amendments from regu- lating the burgeoning government record systems.35 The Fourth and Fifth Amendments protect only against govern- ment infringements , and do nothing to control the collection and use of information by private bureaucracies . Although it does not apply to the private sector , the Fourth Amendment does have the potential to protect against one problem with digital dossiers . The rise of digital dossiers in the private sector is becoming of increasing interest to law enforcement o\ufb03cials . I will discuss this issue in great depth in part III of this book . As I will demonstrate , the secrecy paradigm has made the Fourth Amendment practically inapplicable when the govern- ment seeks to tap into private-sector dossiers . In Smith v. Maryland,36 the Court held that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in the phone numbers one dials . The Court reasoned that such phone numbers were not secret because they were turned over to third par- ties ( phone companies ) .37 Similarly , in United States v. Miller , the Court held that \ufb01nancial records possessed by third parties are not private under the Fourth Amendment.38 The Court \u2019 s focus\u2014which stems from the paradigm that privacy is about protecting one \u2019 s hid- den world\u2014leads it to the view that when a third party has access to one \u2019 s personal information , there can be no expectation of privacy in that information . The Right to Privacy . Beyond speci\ufb01c constitutional provisions , the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution implicitly protects privacy . In \uf731\uf739\uf736\uf735 , in Griswold v. Connecticut , the Court held that a state could not ban the use of or counseling about contraceptives because it invaded the \u201c zone of privacy \u201d protected by the Constitu- tion.39 Although there is no part of the Bill of Rights that directly es- tablishes a right is created by the to privacy , such a right \u201c penumbras \u201d of many of the \uf731\uf730 amendments that form the Bill of t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w \u25b2 Rights . In Roe v. Wade , the Court held that the right to privacy \u201c is broad enough to encompass a woman \u2019 s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \u201d 40 In the \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf737 decision , Whalen v. Roe , the Supreme Court extended substantive due process privacy protection to information privacy . New York passed a law requiring that records be kept of people who obtained prescriptions for certain addictive medications . Plainti\ufb00s argued that the statute infringed upon their right to privacy . The Court held that the constitutionally protected \u201c zone of privacy \u201d ex- tends to"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "two distinct types of interests : ( \uf731 ) \u201c independence in making certain kinds of important decisions \u201d ; and ( \uf732 ) the \u201c individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters. \u201d 41 The former interest re- ferred to the line of cases beginning with Griswold which protected people \u2019 s right to make decisions about their health , bodies , and pro- creation . The latter interest , however , was one that the Court had not previously de\ufb01ned . The plainti\ufb00s argued that they feared the greater accessibility of their personal information and the potential for its disclosure . As a re- sult of this fear , they argued , many patients did not get the prescrip- tions they needed and this interfered with their independence in making decisions with regard to their health . The Court , however , held that the constitutional right to information privacy required only a duty to avoid unreasonable disclosure , and that the state had taken adequate security measures.42 The plainti\ufb00s \u2019 argument , however , was not that disclosure was the real privacy problem . Rather , the plainti\ufb00s were concerned that the collection of and greater access to their information made them lose control over their information . A part of themselves\u2014a very impor- tant part of their lives\u2014was placed in the distant hands of the state and completely outside their control . This is similar to the notion of a chilling e\ufb00ect on free speech , which is not caused by the actual en- forcement of a particular law but by the fear created by the very exis- tence of the law . The Court acknowledged that the court record supported the plainti\ufb00s \u2019 contention that some people were so dis- traught over the law that they were not getting the drugs they needed . However , the Court rejected this argument by noting that because over \uf731\uf730\uf730 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 prescriptions had been \ufb01lled before the law had been \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w enjoined , the public was not denied access to the drugs.43 The prob- lem with the Court \u2019 s response is that the Court failed to indicate how many prescriptions had been \ufb01lled before the law had been passed . Without this data , there is no way to measure the extent of the deter- rence . And even if there were only a few who were deterred , the anxi- ety caused by living under such a regime must also be taken into account . The famous case of Doe v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transporta- tion Authority ( SEPTA ) best illustrates how the constitutional right to information privacy fails to comprehend the privacy problem of data- bases.44 The plainti\ufb00 Doe was HIV positive and told two doctors ( Dr. Press"}]}

His employer , SEPTA , a self-in- sured government agency , maintained a prescription drug program with Rite-Aid as the drug supplier . SEPTA monitored the costs of its program . Doe was taking a drug used exclusively in the treatment of HIV , and he asked Dr. Press whether the SEPTA o\ufb03cials who reviewed the records would see the names for the various prescriptions . Dr. Press said no , and Doe had his prescription \ufb01lled under the plan . Un- fortunately , even though SEPTA never asked for the names , Rite-Aid mistakenly supplied the names corresponding to prescriptions when it sent SEPTA the reports . Pierce , the SEPTA o\ufb03cial reviewing the records , became interested in Doe \u2019 s use of the drug and began to in- vestigate . She asked Dr. Van de Beek about the drug , and he told her what the drug was used for but would not answer any questions about the person using the drugs . Pierce also asked questions of Dr. Press , who informed Doe of Pierce \u2019 s inquiry . This devastated Doe . Doe began to fear that other people at work had found out . He began to perceive that people were treating him di\ufb00erently . However , he was not \ufb01red , and in fact , he was given a pro- motion . The court of appeals held that the constitutional right to in- formation privacy had not been violated because there had not been any disclosure of con\ufb01dential information.45 Pierce had merely in- formed doctors who knew already . Doe o\ufb00ered no proof that anybody else knew , and accordingly , the court weighed his privacy invasion as minimal . t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w \u25b2 However , this missed the crux of Doe \u2019 s complaint . Regardless of whether he was imagining how his co-workers were treating him , he was indeed su\ufb00ering a real , palpable fear . His injury was the power- lessness of having no idea who else knew he had HIV , what his em- ployer thought of him , or how the information could be used against him . This feeling of unease changed the way he perceived everything at his place of employment . The privacy problem wasn \u2019 t merely the fact that Pierce divulged his secret or that Doe himself had lost con- trol over his information , but rather that the information appeared to be entirely out of anyone \u2019 s control .

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) of \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730 , which regulates credit reporting agencies , fails to adequately restrict secondary uses and disclosures of that information.47 Although inspired by allega- tions of abuse and lack of responsiveness of credit agencies , the FCRA was severely weakened due to the e\ufb00ective lobbying of the credit re- porting industry.48 The Act permits credit reporting companies to sell the \u201c credit header \u201d portion of credit histories ( which contains names , addresses , former addresses , telephone number , SSN , employment information , and birthdate ) to marketers.49 The FCRA does little to \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w equalize the unbalanced power relationship between individuals and credit reporting companies . Congress \u2019 s most signi\ufb01cant piece of privacy legislation in the \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730s\u2014the Privacy Act of \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf734\u2014regulates the collection and use of records by federal agencies , giving individuals the right to access and correct information in these records.50 The Privacy Act is a good be- ginning , but it remains incomplete . In particular , it applies only to agencies of the federal government , and has no applicability to the use of databases by businesses and marketers . The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf734 ( FERPA ) , also known as the Buckley Amendment , regulates the accessibility of student records . The FERPA remains quite narrow , only applying to a subset of records in one limited context ( education ) . Excluded are campus security records and health and psychological records.51 The Cable Communications Policy Act ( CCPA ) of \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf734 requires ca- ble operators to inform subscribers about the nature and uses of per- sonal information collected.52 The law prohibits any disclosure that reveals the subscriber \u2019 s viewing habits , and it is enforced with a pri- vate cause of action . The statute , however , applies only to cable oper- ators and it has a broad exception where personal data can be"}]}

In \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf736 , Congress modernized electronic surveillance laws when it passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act ( ECPA ) .53 The ECPA extends the protections of the federal wiretap law of \uf731\uf739\uf736\uf738 to new forms of voice , data , and video communications , including cellular phones and email . The ECPA restricts the interception of transmitted communications and the searching of stored communications . The focus of the law is on regulating surveillance . The di\ufb03culties of the ECPA in responding to the challenges of computer databases is illus- trated by the case In re DoubleClick , Inc. Privacy Litigation.54 A group of plainti\ufb00s pro\ufb01led by DoubleClick contended that DoubleClick \u2019 s placing and accessing cookies on their hard drives constituted unau- thorized access in violation of ECPA . The court concluded that the ECPA didn \u2019 t apply to DoubleClick because its cookies were perma- t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w \u25b2 nent and ECPA restricted unauthorized access only to communica- tions in \u201c temporary , intermediate storage. \u201d Additionally , DoubleClick didn \u2019 t illegally intercept a communication in violation of the ECPA because DoubleClick was authorized to access the cookies by the websites that people visited . The DoubleClick case illustrates that the ECPA is not well-tailored to addressing a large portion of private-sec- tor information gathering in cyberspace . After reporters obtained Supreme Court Justice nominee Robert Bork \u2019 s videocassette rental data , Congress passed the Video Privacy Protection Act ( VPPA ) of \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf738,55 which has become known as the Bork Bill . The VPPA prohibits videotape service providers from disclosing the titles of the videos a person rents or buys . People are authorized to sue if the statute is violated.56 However , the Act only applies to video stores , and no similar restrictions are placed on bookstores , record stores , or any other type of retailer , magazine producer , or cat- alog company . The Telephone Consumer Protection Act ( TCPA ) of \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf731 permits in- dividuals to sue a telemarketer for damages up to $ \uf735\uf730\uf730 for each call received after requesting not to be called again.57 If the telemarketer knowingly breaks the law , then the penalty is trebled . The TCPA , how- ever , aims at redressing the aggravation of disruptive phone calls , and it does not govern the collection , use , or sale of personal data . In \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf734 , Congress \ufb01nally addressed the longstanding practice of many states of selling personal information in their motor vehicle records to marketers . The Driver \u2019 s Privacy Protection Act of \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf734 ( DPPA ) limits this practice ,"}]}

States are not limited in disclosing in- formation contained in the numerous other forms of records they maintain . In \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf736 , Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Ac- countability Act ( HIPAA ) to help standardize medical information so it could be transferred more easily between di\ufb00erent databases.59 Since this raised privacy concerns , Congress ordered the Department \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) to regulate the privacy of med- ical records . HHS \u2019 s regulations , among other things , require authori- zation for all uses and disclosures beyond those for treatment , payment , or health care operation ( such as for marketing purposes ) .60 The HIPAA regulations have apparently pleased nobody . Doctors and hospitals complain that the regulations are too complicated , cumber- some , and expensive to follow . Advocates for privacy \ufb01nd the regula- tions weak and ine\ufb00ective . The \ufb01rst federal law directly addressing privacy in cyberspace , the Children \u2019 s Online Privacy Protection Act ( COPPA ) of \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738 , regulates the collection of children \u2019 s personal information on the Internet.61 Websites targeted at children must post privacy policies and must ob- tain parental consent in order to use children \u2019 s personal information . But the law \u2019 s reach is limited . It applies only to children \u2019 s websites or when the website operator \u201c has actual knowledge that it is collecting personal information from a child. \u201d 62 Only children under age \uf731\uf733 are covered . Additionally , as privacy law expert Anita Allen argues , the law forces parents to become involved in their children \u2019 s Internet ac- tivities when some parents \u201c may want their children to have free ac- cess to the Internet for moral or political reasons. \u201d Allen concludes that \u201c COPPA is among the most paternalistic and authoritarian of the federal privacy statutes thus far. \u201d 63 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley ( GLB ) Act of \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739 permits any \ufb01nancial institution to share \u201c nonpublic personal information \u201d with a\ufb03liated companies.64 However , people can opt-out when a company discloses personal information to third parties.65 In practice , the GLB Act greatly facilitates the disclosure of people \u2019 s information . Given the large conglomerates of today \u2019 s corporate world , a\ufb03liate sharing is signi\ufb01cant . For example , Experian , one of the three largest credit re- porting agencies , was purchased by Great Universal Stores , a British retail corporation ,"}]}

Addi- tionally , the Act \u2019 s opt-out right is ine\ufb00ective . As legal scholars Ted Janger and Paul Schwartz argue , the \ufb01nancial institution has \u201c supe- rior knowledge \u201d and the GLB \u201c leaves the burden of bargaining on the t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w \u25b2 less informed party , the individual consumer. \u201d 67 They conclude that \u201c [ a ] n opt-out default creates incentives for privacy notices that lead to inaction by the consumer. \u201d 68 In sum , the federal laws are a start , but they often give people only a very limited form of control over only some of their information and frequently impose no system of default control on other holders of such information.69 Although the statutes help in containing the spread of information , they often fail to adequately address the un- derlying power relationships and contain broad exceptions and loop- holes that limit their e\ufb00ectiveness . Furthermore , the federal statutes cover only a small geography of the database problem . As privacy law expert Joel Reidenberg has pointed out , the laws are \u201c sectoral \u201d in nature , dealing with privacy in certain contexts but leaving gaping holes in others.70 \u201c This mosaic ap- proach , \u201d he observes , \u201c derives from the traditional American fear of government intervention in private activities and the reluctance to broadly regulate industry . The result of the mosaic is a rather haphaz- ard and unsatisfactory response to each of the privacy concerns. \u201d 71 Thus , the federal privacy statutes form a complicated patchwork of regulation with signi\ufb01cant gaps and omissions . For example , federal regulation covers federal agency records , educational records , cable television records , video rental records , and state motor vehicle records , but it does not cover most records maintained by state and local o\ufb03cials , as well as a host of other records held by libraries , char- ities , and merchants ( i.e. , supermarkets , department stores , mail or- der catalogs , bookstores , and the like ) . The COPPA protects the privacy of children under \uf731\uf733 on the Internet , but there is no protection for adults . As political scientist Colin Bennett observes , \u201c [ t ] he ap- proach to making privacy policy in the United States is reactive rather than anticipatory , incremental rather than comprehensive , and frag- mented rather than coherent . There may be a lot of laws , but"}]}

It is often di\ufb03cult , if not impossible , for an individual to \ufb01nd out if in- formation has been disclosed . A person who begins receiving unso- licited marketing mail and email may have a clue that some entity has disclosed her personal information , but that person often will not be \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w able to discover which entity was the culprit . Indeed , the trade in per- sonal information is a clandestine underworld , one that is not ex- posed su\ufb03ciently by federal privacy regulation to enable e\ufb00ective enforcement . The Kafka metaphor illustrates that the problem with digital dossiers involves the fact that our personal information is not only out of our control but also is often placed within a bureaucratic process that lacks control and discipline in handling and using such information . The federal statutes have certainly made advances in protecting against this problem , and they demonstrate that Con- gress \u2019 s resolve to protect privacy has remained strong for over \uf733\uf730 years . But much more work remains to be done . The FTC and Unfair and Deceptive Practices Since \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738 , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has been bringing actions against companies that violate their own privacy policies . The FTC has interpreted the FTC Act , which prohibits \u201c unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or a\ufb00ecting commerce , \u201d 73 to be infringed when a company breaks a promise it made in its privacy policy . The FTC can bring civil actions and seek injunctive remedies . Since it began en- forcing the Act in this manner , the FTC has brought several high- pro\ufb01le cases , almost all of which have resulted in settlements.74 Yet , the FTC has been rather weak and reactive in its enforcement of privacy policies.75 In a number of cases involving companies engag- ing in blatant breaches of their own privacy policies , the FTC has set- tled , simply requiring companies to sin no more.76 A recent case involving Microsoft , however , suggests that the FTC might become more proactive . Microsoft \u2019 s Passport maintains the personal informa- tion of Internet users to allow them to use a single username and password to access many di\ufb00erent websites without having to sign on to each separately . Although Microsoft promised in its privacy policy that it protected Passport information with \u201c powerful online security technology , \u201d the FTC concluded that Microsoft did not provide ade- quate security . Microsoft and the FTC agreed on a settlement where Microsoft must create a better system of security.77 Unlike most cases t h e p r"}]}

In the end , however , the FTC is limited in its reach . It only ensures that companies keep their promises . As Paul Schwartz notes , if a web- site doesn \u2019 t make a promise about privacy , then it will \u201c fall outside of the FTC \u2019 s jurisdiction. \u201d 78 Unfortunately , the FTC has only limited time and resources , and its \u201c privacy protection activities already are dwarfed by its more aggressive investigations of fraud and deceptive marketing practices on the Internet. \u201d 79 A World of Radical Transparency : Freedom of Information Law Some commentators suggest that there is little the law can do to pro- tect privacy in the Information Age . In The Transparent Society , tech- nology commentator David Brin argues that privacy is dead : [ I ] t is already far too late to prevent the invasion of cameras and databases . The djinn can not be crammed back into its bottle . No matter how many laws are passed , it will prove quite impossible to legislate away the new surveillance tools and databases . They are here to stay . Light is going to shine into every corner of our lives.80 Brin suggests that we abandon privacy in favor of a transparent soci- ety , one where everything is out in the open , where we watch the watchers , where we have the ability to monitor the elites\u2014the politi- cians and the corporate leaders\u2014just as much as they have the ability to monitor us . \u201c [ W ] e may not be able to eliminate the intrusive glare shining on citizens of the [ twenty-\ufb01rst century ] , \u201d Brin observes , \u201c but the glare just might be rendered harmless through the application of more light aimed in the other direction. \u201d 81 We should thus regulate in favor of mandating free access to information . According to Brin , a truly transparent society would hold accountable those who would violate our privacy.82 Brin fails to realize that a\ufb00ording mutuality of access to informa- tion will do little to empower ordinary individuals . The reason is that information is much more of an e\ufb00ective tool in the hands of a large \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w bureaucracy . Information is not the key to power in the Information Age\u2014knowledge is . Information consists of raw facts . Knowledge is information that has been sifted , sorted , and analyzed ."}]}

In order to solve the problem , a transparent society would have to make each individual as competent as bureaucratic organizations in processing information into knowledge . The Law of Information Privacy and Its Shortcomings As this chapter has demonstrated , the law of information privacy is quite extensive . It developed in response to certain vexing privacy problems , often created by new technologies . The Warren and Bran- deis privacy torts were inspired by new photographic technology and a rapidly growing media that was becoming very sensationalistic . The types of injuries Warren and Brandeis had in mind were those caused by intrusive newsgathering techniques and by publishing private in- formation in the newspapers . In the mid-twentieth century , during the Cold War , the law focused heavily on surveillance , which had be- come one the central threats to privacy . These times witnessed the growth of electronic communication along with new means of elec- tronic espionage such as wiretapping , bugging devices , and video cameras . Americans feared the terrible totalitarian regimes of Nazi Germany , the Soviet Union , and Eastern Europe , all of which em- ployed extensive monitoring of their citizens \u2019 private lives as well as secret police and spies to maintain strict control . Law enforcement o\ufb03cials in the United States also increasingly resorted to the use of surveillance , with the rapidly growing FBI leading the way . It is there- fore certainly not surprising that the privacy law forged during these times was devoted to ameliorating the kinds of harms so perfectly captured in Orwell \u2019 s 1984 . However , the advent of the computer , the proliferation of data- bases , and the birth of the Internet have created a new breed of pri- vacy problems . The Orwellian dangers have certainly not disappeared ; nor have the harms created by the sensationalistic me- dia . But the rise of digital dossiers has created new and di\ufb00erent t h e p r o b l e m s o f i n f o r m a t i o n p r i v a c y l a w \u25b2 problems . New privacy laws have been created in response . The con- stitutional right to information privacy has emerged in the courts as a spino\ufb00 of the regular constitutional right to privacy . Congress and the states have passed numerous statutes to regulate the collection and use of personal information . The FTC has started to bring enforce- ment actions against companies that fail to live up to their privacy promises . All of these developments have been promising , but as I have shown throughout this chapter , the law of privacy has not dealt e\ufb00ectively with the new problems"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "created by digital dossiers . The rea- son is that the law still harbors conceptions of privacy that are not re- sponsive to the realities of the Information Age . These new privacy problems are not isolated infringements , but are systematic and di- \ufb00use . They are often not created by a single perpetrator , but by a com- bination of actors often without sinister purposes . The problems caused by digital dossiers are quite broad , and they apply to the entire information economy , making the narrow federal statutes inapplica- ble to a large portion of the \ufb02ow of personal information . Enforcing rights and remedies against the collection and use of personal infor- mation is very di\ufb03cult since much information \ufb02ow occurs without people even knowing about it . So what can be done ? I have demonstrated some of the law \u2019 s short- comings . Can the law adequately respond to these problems ? This question will be the focus of the next chapter and beyond . T h e L i m i t s o f M a r k e t - B a s e d S o l u t i o n s Many solutions to the problems of privacy and information are mar- ket-based , relying on property rights or contractual default rules to regulate the \ufb02ow of information . Does the market already adequately protect privacy ? Or can the market , with minor tinkering , develop e\ufb00ective privacy protection ? Or must a more radical reconstruction of the market be undertaken ? Market-Based Solutions Property Rights and Contract . The notion of \u201c control of personal infor- mation \u201d is one of the most dominant conceptions of privacy . As pri- vacy expert Alan Westin declares : \u201c Privacy is the claim of individuals , groups , or institutions to determine for themselves when , how , and to what extent information about them is communicated to others. \u201d 1 Numerous other scholars embrace this de\ufb01nition.2 Theorists who view privacy as control over information frequently understand it within the framework of property and contract con- cepts . This is not the only way control can be understood , but the 76 \u25b2 t h e l i m i t s o f m a r k e t - b a s e d s o l u t i o n s \u25b2 leading commentators often de\ufb01ne it in terms of ownership\u2014as a property right in information.3 Understood in such terms , control over something entails a bundle of legal rights of ownership , such as rights of possession , alienability , exclusion of others , commercial ex- ploitation , and so on.4 This is what leads Westin to conclude : \u201c [ P ] er- sonal information , thought of as the right of decision over one \u2019 s private personality , should be de\ufb01ned as a property right. \u201d 5 The"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mar- ket discourse focuses the debate around who should own certain kinds of information as well as what the appropriate contractual rules should be for trading personal information . Therefore , in addition to property rights , contract law plays an important role in regulating privacy . Parties can make contractual agreements about privacy at the outset of forming a relationship . In certain instances , courts have held that even though the contract did not speci\ufb01cally mention privacy , it is an implied term in the con- tract . The common law tort of breach of con\ufb01dentiality embodies this view . It enables people to sue for damages when a party breaches a contractual obligation ( often implied rather than ex- press ) to maintain con\ufb01dentiality . This tort primarily protects the privacy of the patient-physician relationship.6 The tort also has been used to protect against banks breaching the con\ufb01dences of their customers.7 Implied contractual terms are a form of default rule in the con- tract . Contractual default rules are the initial set of rules that regulate market transactions . These rules are merely a starting point ; they govern only when the parties to a transaction do not negotiate for a di\ufb00erent set of rules . As legal scholar Ian Ayres and economist Robert Gertner explain , \u201c default rules \u201d are rules \u201c that parties can contract around by prior agreement \u201d while \u201c immutable rules \u201d ( or inalienabil- ity rules ) are rules that \u201c parties can not change by contractual agree- ment. \u201d 8 Most market proponents favor default rules that can be bargained around . Market solution proponents , however , are cer- tainly not in agreement over the types of property entitlements and contractual default rules that should be required . But once these are established , then the market can do the rest . People and companies can buy and sell personal information and make contracts about the protection of privacy . For example , a number of commentators \u25b2 t h e l i m i t s o f m a r k e t - b a s e d s o l u t i o n s recommend contractual solutions to safeguard privacy , such as where consumers license the use of their data to businesses.9 Although some might argue that personal information is owned by the individual to whom it pertains based on a natural rights theory or some form of inherent connection , many commentators who ap- proach privacy in terms of property rights assign initial entitlements instrumentally . They claim that the market will achieve the ideal amount of privacy by balancing the value of personal information to a company ( i.e. , its commercial value in the marketplace ) against the value of the information to the individual and the larger social value of having the information within the individual \u2019 s control.10 The role of law is to assign the"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "initial entitlements . Thus , the debate in this dis- course centers around who should own certain kinds of information . So who should own personal information when people transact with businesses ? The individuals to whom the information pertains ? Or the companies that collect it ? Judge Richard Posner suggests that the law should often favor the companies over the individuals . Posner translates control of informa- tion into property concepts . Society should provide individuals a property right in true information about themselves when it will fos- ter more e\ufb03cient transactions.11 With regard to the sale of customer lists , Posner argues that \u201c the costs of obtaining subscriber approval would be high relative to the value of the list. \u201d He concludes : \u201c If , therefore , we believe that these lists are generally worth more to the purchasers than being shielded from possible unwanted solicitations is worth to subscribers , we should assign the property right to the [ companies ] ; and the law does this. \u201d 12 In contrast , law professor Richard Murphy concludes that in many instances , contractual default rules mandating con\ufb01dentiality of per- sonal information are more e\ufb03cient than default rules permitting disclosure.13 For Murphy , privacy has \u201c substantial economic bene\ufb01ts \u201d because \u201c [ u ] nless a person can investigate without risk of reproach what his own preferences are , he will not be able to maximize his own happiness. \u201d 14 Likewise , Jerry Kang views personal information as a form of prop- erty and advocates for a market solution . He recognizes that there are compelling non-market perceptions of privacy that view privacy as a t h e l i m i t s o f m a r k e t - b a s e d s o l u t i o n s \u25b2 human value and that this way of understanding privacy is \u201c poorly translated , if at all , into e\ufb03ciency terms. \u201d Nevertheless , he favors the market approach . Kang recognizes that merely assigning a default rule as to the ownership of information will be ine\ufb00ective because in- dividuals lack convenient ways to \ufb01nd out what information about them is collected and how it is used . Thus , he advocates a contractual default rule that \u201c personal information may be processed in only functionally necessary ways \u201d and that parties are \u201c free to contract around the default rule. \u201d Kang claims that inalienability rules would be too paternalistic because individuals should be able to sell or dis- close their information if they desire . Inalienability rules will risk \u201c sur- rendering control over information privacy to the state. \u201d 15 Internet law expert Lawrence Lessig also recommends a market- based approach . He argues that a property regime permits each indi- vidual to decide for herself what information to give out and \u201c protects both those who value their privacy more than"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "others and those who value it less. \u201d Lessig notes that our existing system of posting privacy policies and enabling consumers to opt in or out has high transaction costs because people do not have \u201c the time or patience to read through cumbersome documents describing obscure rules for con- trolling data. \u201d Therefore , Lessig recommends that computer software be crafted to act akin to an \u201c electronic butler , \u201d negotiating our privacy concerns : \u201c The user sets her preferences once\u2014speci\ufb01es how she would negotiate privacy and what she is willing to give up\u2014and from that moment on , when she enters a site , the site and her machine ne- gotiate . Only if the machines can agree will the site be able to obtain her personal data. \u201d 16 In other words , Lessig suggests a technological implementation for a market system where people have property rights in their information . Self-Regulation . Some commentators\u2014especially people in the data- base industry\u2014argue that the market is functioning optimally and is already adequately accounting for privacy concerns.17 The market , they argue , is already treating personal information as a property right owned by individuals . Companies have increasingly been adopting privacy policies , which can operate as a form of contractual promise limiting the future uses of the information . The exchange of \u25b2 t h e l i m i t s o f m a r k e t - b a s e d s o l u t i o n s personal information for something of value is already beginning to take place . Many websites require people to supply personal informa- tion in order to gain access to information on the website . Under the market approach , this practice can be justi\ufb01ed as an information trade.18 In order to receive such services as book recommendations , software upgrades , free email , and personal web pages , users must re- linquish personal information not knowing its potential uses . In short , useful information and services are being exchanged for per- sonal information , and this represents the going \u201c price \u201d of privacy . Moreover , there are market incentives for companies to keep their data secret and to be honest about their data collection . There have been a number of instances where companies have canceled various initiatives due to public outcry over privacy . For example , in response to privacy concerns , Yahoo ! eliminated the reverse telephone number search from its People Search site.19 In the early \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf730s , in response to a public outcry , Lotus Corporation scrapped plans to sell a database containing the names , addresses , income brackets , and lifestyle data of \uf731\uf732\uf730 million citizens.20 In \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf736 , Lexis-Nexis announced its P-TRAK Personal Locator , which would provide addresses , maiden names , and SSNs of millions of people .

Legal scholar Fred Cate contends that information \ufb02ow makes the consumer credit system cheaper and faster , \u201c enhances customer convenience and service , \u201d and enables businesses \u201c to ascertain customer needs accurately and meet those needs rapidly and e\ufb03ciently. \u201d 23 Many people want some targeted marketing and enjoy receiving information about products more tai- lored to their tastes .

Misgivings of the Market Understanding the privacy problem of databases in terms of the Kafka metaphor\u2014our helplessness and vulnerability in the face of the powerful bureaucracies that handle our personal data\u2014reveals that there are several de\ufb01ciencies in market solutions . The Limitations of Contract Law . Although contract law can protect pri- vacy within relationships formed between parties , it does not redress privacy invasions by third parties outside of the contractual bonds . Warren and Brandeis recognized this problem back in \uf731\uf738\uf739\uf730 when they spoke of new photographic technologies . Cameras had been quite large , and people had to pose to have their picture taken . This would likely require people to establish some sort of contractual relation- ship with the photographer . But the development of cheaper portable cameras in the \uf731\uf738\uf738\uf730s enabled strangers to take pictures without the subject ever knowing.26 Today , our personal information"}]}

For example , as public health law expert Lawrence Gostin notes , the law of patient-physician con\ufb01dentiality \u201c is premised on the exis- tence of a relationship between a physician and a patient , although most health information is not generated within this relationship. \u201d 27 Information is often maintained not just by one \u2019 s physician , but one \u2019 s \u25b2 t h e l i m i t s o f m a r k e t - b a s e d s o l u t i o n s health plan , government agencies , health care clearinghouse organi- zations , and many others . Problems with Bargaining Power . There are great inequalities in bargain- ing power in many situations involving privacy , such as employment contracts or contracts between big corporations and individuals . How many people are able to bargain e\ufb00ectively over their contracts with their Internet Service Providers , cable providers , telephone com- panies , and the like ? Oscar Gandy observes that \u201c individuals are largely \u2018 contract term takers \u2019 in the bulk of their economic relations with organizations. \u201d 28 People frequently accede to standardized con- tract terms without putting up much of a \ufb01ght.29 Nor does it appear that market competition is producing a wide menu of privacy protections . Companies only rarely compete on the basis of the amount of privacy they o\ufb00er . People often do not weigh privacy policies heavily when choosing companies . For example , people rarely choose phone companies based on their privacy poli- cies . Self-regulatory proponents would respond that this fact indicates that privacy isn \u2019 t very important to most people . If people really cared about privacy , the self-regulators argue , then they would refuse to deal with companies o\ufb00ering inadequate levels of privacy . But as Paul Schwartz contends , there are coordination problems because \u201c indi- viduals may have di\ufb03culty \ufb01nding e\ufb00ective ways to express collec- tively their relative preferences for privacy. \u201d 30 Although more companies that routinely collect and use personal information are posting privacy policies , these policies have several di\ufb03culties . Privacy policies are often written in obtuse prose and crammed with extraneous information.31 But market proponents\u2014 especially those favoring self-regulation\u2014counter that many people don \u2019 t bother to read privacy policies . This may not necessarily stem from their turgid prose , but from the fact that consumers don \u2019 t want to take the time to read them . Perhaps people just don \u2019 t care . However , perhaps the lack of interest in privacy policies may stem from the fact that the policies hardly amount to a meaningful con- tract , where the parties bargain over the terms .

Privacy policies tend to be self-indulgent , making vague promises such as the fact that a company will be careful with data ; that it will respect privacy ; that privacy is its number one concern . These public relations statements are far from reliable and are often phrased in a vague , self-aggrandizing manner to make the corpora- tion look good . What consumers do not receive is a frank and detailed description of what will and will not be done with their information , what speci\ufb01c information security measures are being taken , and what speci\ufb01c rights of recourse they have . People must rely on the good graces of companies that possess their data to keep it secure and to prevent its abuse . They have no say in how much money and e\ufb00ort will be allocated to security ; no say in which employees get ac- cess ; and no say in what steps are taken to ensure that unscrupulous employees do not steal or misuse their information . Instead , privacy policies only vaguely state that the company will treat information se- curely . Particular measures are not described , and individuals have no control over those measures . Most privacy policies provide no way for customers to prevent changes in the policy , and they lack a binding enforcement mecha- nism . Frequently , companies revise their privacy policies , making it even more di\ufb03cult for an individual to keep track . Yahoo ! \u2019 s privacy policy indicates that it \u201c may change from time to time , so please check back periodically. \u201d 32 AOL once told its subscribers that their pri- vacy preferences had expired and that if they did not \ufb01ll out a new opt-out form , then their personal information would be distributed to marketers.33 Further , personal information databases can be sold to other businesses with less protective privacy policies , especially when a company goes bankrupt . For example , in \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730 , Internet toy retailer Toysmart.com \ufb01led for bankruptcy and attempted to auction o\ufb00 its personal information database of over \uf732\uf730\uf730 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 customers.34 Dot-com bankruptcies create a breakdown in the relationship between compa- nies and consumers , resulting in little incentive for the bankrupt company to take measures to protect consumer data . Personal infor- mation databases are often a company \u2019 s most valuable asset and could be sold to third parties at bankruptcy to pay o\ufb00 creditors.35 Second , to the extent that privacy policies do provide individuals with privacy protection , it is often provided with an opt-out system , \u25b2 t h e l i m i t s o f m a r k e t - b a s e d s o l"}]}

Opt-out systems require individuals to check a box , send a letter , make a telephone call , or take other proactive steps to indicate their preferences . However , these steps are often time- consuming . There are too many collectors of information for a right of opt-out to be e\ufb00ective . Without a centralized mechanism for indi- viduals to opt-out , individuals would have to spend much of their time guarding their privacy like a hawk . The Direct Marketing Association ( DMA ) has established a system where consumers can be placed on a no-solicitation list . This is es- sentially a database of people who do not want to be in databases . The service records their preference , but does not remove their name from any list.36 The database is then sent to the subscribing compa- nies so that they can stop mailings to those names.37 However , many people are unaware of this option , numerous companies are not members of the DMA , and many members fail to comply with DMA guidelines . As legal scholar Je\ufb00 Sovern argues , opt-out systems pro- vide little incentive to companies to make opting-out easy ; \u201c compa- nies will incur transaction costs in notifying consumers of the existence of the opt-out option and in responding to consumers who opt out. \u201d 38 Since companies want to use personal information , their incentive in an opt-out system is to make opting-out more di\ufb03cult.39 These problems arise because people often lack su\ufb03cient bargain- ing power over their privacy . As privacy law expert Peter Swire ob- serves , it is di\ufb03cult for consumers to bargain with large corporations about their privacy because they lack expertise in privacy issues and because it takes substantial time and e\ufb00ort.40 Information collection is duplicitous , clandestine , and often coerced . The law currently does not provide meaningful ability to refuse to consent to relinquish in- formation . The FCRA , for example , mandates that individuals con- sent before an employer can obtain their credit report . According to Joel Reidenberg : \u201c Frequently , individuals will be asked to sign blanket consent statements authorizing inquiry into credit reporting agency \ufb01les and disclosures of information for any purpose . These consents rarely identify the credit reporting agencies or all the uses to which the personal information will be put. \u201d 41 This consent is virtually meaningless . When people seek medical care , among the forms they t h e l i m i t s o f m a r k e t - b a s e d s o l u t i o n s \u25b2 sign are general consent forms which permit the disclosure of one \u2019 s medical records to anyone with a need to see them .

People will be given con- sent forms with vague \ufb01ne-print discussions of the contractual default privacy rules that they are waiving , and they will sign them without thought . As Julie Cohen correctly contends , \u201c [ f ] reedom of choice in markets requires accurate information about choices and other consequences , and enough power\u2014in terms of wealth , num- bers , or control over resources\u2014to have choices. \u201d 42 The bargaining process must be made easier . The way things currently stand , most people don \u2019 t know even know where to begin if they want to assert their preference for privacy . The One-Size-Fits-All Problem . Even assuming these problems could be dealt with , a number of additional di\ufb03culties remain that prevent in- dividuals from exercising their preferences to protect their privacy . A\ufb00ording individuals a right to control their personal data improperly assumes that individuals have the ability to exercise meaningful con- trol over their information.43 Paul Schwartz notes how consent screens on a website asking users to relinquish control over informa- tion often do so on a \u201c take-it-or-leave-it basis \u201d resulting in the \u201c \ufb01c- tion \u201d that people have \u201c expressed informed consent to [ the website \u2019 s ] data processing practices. \u201d 44 Individuals are often presented with an all-or-nothing choice : either agree to all forms of information collec- tion and use or to none whatsoever . Such a limited set of choices does not permit individuals to express their preferences accurately . Indi- viduals frequently desire to consent to certain uses of their personal information , but they do not want to relinquish their information for all possible future uses . For example , a person may want to purchase books from an online bookseller . Suppose that the person \u2019 s privacy preferences consist of the information being kept very secure , not being disclosed to the \u25b2 t h e l i m i t s o f m a r k e t - b a s e d s o l u t i o n s government , and not being traded or disclosed to other companies ( even in the event that the company goes bankrupt ) . But the online bookseller \u2019 s privacy policy is standardized and often does not address these points with any reasonable degree of speci\ufb01city .

There , the privacy policies are not even readily available to the purchaser . This state of a\ufb00airs exists partly because not many choices are available to people regarding their privacy and partly because people are often not aware of the problems , risks , and dangers about how their information is handled . Even if they were , it is doubtful whether a person could create a special deal with a company to provide greater protections for her privacy.45 Therefore , with regard to the level of privacy protection o\ufb00ered by companies , a person must simply take it or leave it . People are not a\ufb00orded enough choices to exercise their privacy preferences . A more complete range of choices must permit individuals to express their preferences for how information will be protected , how it will be used in the future , and with whom it will be shared . Moreover , because companies controlling personal in- formation are secretive about its uses and vague about their privacy policies , people lack adequate knowledge to make meaningful choices . Market proponents might respond that it is not economically fea- sible for companies to o\ufb00er customized privacy policies . This would require companies to keep track of each particular customer \u2019 s privacy preferences , which could be cumbersome and expensive . However , companies maintain very complex databases , able to handle count- less \ufb01elds of data and multiple variables . Why can \u2019 t various privacy preferences be recorded along with various pieces of information ? Inequalities in Knowledge . The argument that the market is already pro- viding the optimal level of privacy protection fails because there are vast inequalities in knowledge and much data collection is clandes- tine . Despite the few instances where information collection initia- tives were canceled due to public complaints over privacy , many new , t h e l i m i t s o f m a r k e t - b a s e d s o l u t i o n s \u25b2 ambitious information gathering endeavors occur outside of the pub- lic eye . At any given time , one of thousands of companies or govern- ment agencies could decide on a new use of information or on a new form of collection . People should not always have to be ready to mount a large campaign anytime such an eruption could occur . Many of the activities of the database industry are not well known to the public , and will remain that way under default notions of corporate privacy and trade secrets unless something is changed . Ironically , corporate bureaucracies sometimes have more privacy rights than in- dividuals . The Value of Personal Information A key aspect of property rights , observes information law scholar Pamela Samuelson , is that property is alienable\u2014people can readily trade it away.46"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Market solutions , which view information as property that can be traded in the market , depend upon the ability of people to accurately assess the value of information . As legal scholar Katrin By- ford aptly notes , assigning property rights in information \u201c values pri- vacy only to the extent it is considered to be of personal worth by the individual who claims it. \u201d 47 The value of personal information is de- termined by how much it takes for a person to relinquish it . Since people routinely give out their personal information for shopping discount cards , for access to websites , and even for free , some market proponents ( especially the self-regulators ) argue that the value of the data is very low to the individuals . The market is thus already ade- quately compensating individuals for the use of their information . In a well-functioning market , assuming no market failure , the mar- ket might work quite well in valuing personal information . But the market in privacy is not a well-functioning market , and thus its valua- tion determinations are suspect . The Aggregation Effect . The aggregation e\ufb00ect severely complicates the individual \u2019 s ability to ascribe a value to personal information . An in- dividual may give out bits of information in di\ufb00erent contexts , each transfer appearing innocuous . However , when aggregated , the infor- mation becomes much more revealing . As law professor Julie Cohen \u25b2 t h e l i m i t s o f m a r k e t - b a s e d s o l u t i o n s observes , each instance in which we give out personal information may seem \u201c trivial and incremental , \u201d which \u201c tends to minimize its ulti- mate e\ufb00ect. \u201d 48 It is the totality of information about a person and how it is used that poses the greatest threat to privacy . From the stand- point of each particular information transaction , individuals will not have enough facts to make a truly informed decision . Uncertain Future Uses . The potential future uses of personal informa- tion are too vast and unknown to enable individuals to make the ap- propriate valuation . The value of much personal information , such as one \u2019 s SSN , does not stem from its intimacy , its immediate revelations of selfhood , or the fact that the individual has authored it . Rather , the value is in the ability to prevent others from gaining power and con- trol over an individual ; from revealing an individual \u2019 s private life ; and from making the individual vulnerable to fraud , identity theft , prying , snooping , and the like . Because this value is linked to uncertain fu- ture uses , it is di\ufb03cult , if not impossible , for an individual to ade- quately value her information ."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since the ownership model involves individuals relinquishing full title to the information , they have little idea how such information will be used when in the hands of others . For example , a person who signs up for a discount supermarket shopper card might have some vague knowledge that her personal in- formation will be collected . In the abstract , this knowledge may not be all that disconcerting . But what if the person were told that infor- mation about the contraceptives and over-the-counter medications she buys would be made available to her employer ? Or given to the government ? Or used to send her advertisements or spam ? Without being informed about how the information will be used , the individ- ual lacks the necessary knowledge to assess the implications of sur- rendering her personal data . Is Privacy a Property Right ? When personal information is understood as a property right , the value of privacy often is translated into the com- bined monetary value of particular pieces of personal information . Privacy becomes the right to pro\ufb01t from one \u2019 s personal data , and the harm to privacy becomes understood as not being adequately paid t h e l i m i t s o f m a r k e t - b a s e d s o l u t i o n s \u25b2 for the use of this \u201c property. \u201d But is this really the harm ? Can privacy be translated into property concepts without losing some of its meaning ? 49 An initial di\ufb03culty with understanding personal information as a form of property is that it is unclear who really creates the informa- tion . Some pro-privacy commentators quickly assume that because information pertains to a person , the person should have a right to own it . However , information is often not created by the individual alone . We often develop personal information through our relation- ships with others . When a person purchases a product , information is created through the interaction of seller and buyer . Consider the case of Dwyer v. American Express Co. American Ex- press cardholders sued American Express for renting their names to merchants under both invasion of privacy and appropriation . The court held that by using the credit card , \u201c a cardholder is voluntarily , and necessarily , giving information to defendants that , if analyzed , will reveal a cardholder \u2019 s spending habits and shopping preferences. \u201d Thus , there was no invasion of privacy . As for appropriation , the court reasoned : Undeniably , each cardholder \u2019 s name is valuable to defendants . The more names included on a list , the more that list will be worth . However , a single , random cardholder \u2019 s name has little or no intrinsic value to defendants ( or a merchant ) . Rather , an indi- vidual name has"}]}

Defendants create value by categorizing and aggregating these names . Furthermore , defendants \u2019 practices do not deprive any of the cardholders of any value their individual names may possess.50 This case indicates what is omitted when information privacy is re- duced to property rights in information . The court only focused on the value of the information to each individual , not on the systemic harms to which American Express \u2019 s practices contributed\u2014namely , the powerlessness of the individuals to have any meaningful control over information pertaining to their personal lives . The problem with databases is not that information collectors fail to compensate people \u25b2 t h e l i m i t s o f m a r k e t - b a s e d s o l u t i o n s for the proper value of personal information . The problem is people \u2019 s lack of control , their lack of knowledge about how data will be used in the future , and their lack of participation in the process . It is not merely su\ufb03cient to allow people to sell their information , relinquish all title to it , and allow companies to use it as they see \ufb01t . This provides people with an all-or-nothing type of exchange , which they are likely to take when they are unaware of how information can or might be used in the future . Nor is it enough to attach some default contractual rights to information transactions such as nondisclosure obligations or a requirement of noti\ufb01cation when a future use of information is employed . These solutions can not work e\ufb00ectively in a situation where the power relationship between individuals and public and private bureaucracies is so greatly unbalanced . In other words , the problem with market solutions is not merely that it is di\ufb03cult to com- modify information ( which it is ) , but also that a regime of default rules alone ( consisting of property rights in information and contrac- tual defaults ) will not enable fair and equitable market transactions in personal information . As Julie Cohen warns , giving people property rights in a defective market runs the risk of leading to more trade in personal information , not less.51 Due to the problems with ascribing a value to personal informa- tion and because privacy is an issue about societal structure involving our relationships with public and private bureaucracies , some form of regulation is necessary that exceeds the narrow measures pro- posed by proponents of a market solution . There are certain rights we can not bargain away because they are not mere individual posses- sions but are important for the structure of society as a whole . Too Much Paternalism ?

For example , people may want their names sold to other com- panies because they like receiving catalogs . Market proponents thus aim to preserve individual choice . The problem , however , is that the market currently fails to provide mechanisms to enable individuals to exercise informed meaningful choices . Even market approaches favoring a more pro-privacy regime of contractual default rules neglect to account for the core of the database problem as illustrated by the Kafka metaphor\u2014the power inequalities that pervade the world of information transfers between individuals and bureaucracies . As a result of these problems , there is little economic incentive for companies to adopt strong privacy protection in the absence of legal regulation . Although the Direct Marketing Association ( DMA ) main- tains standards for self-regulation , polls suggest that less than \uf732\uf735 per- cent of DMA members adhere to self-regulatory practices.52 The individual \u2019 s lack of knowledge about the use of personal information also makes companies less responsive to privacy concerns . One em- ployee at a bank stated : \u201c We joke about it all the time because we o\ufb03- cially say that we don \u2019 t reveal information and we treat it with the utmost respect . What a crock .

I am not arguing that the market can \u2019 t protect privacy . The market can work well , but not in the absence of structural legal protections . A set of laws and rights is necessary to govern our relationship with bu- reaucracies . These laws must consist of more than default rules that can be contracted around or property entitlements that can be bartered away . Market-based solutions work within the existing mar- ket ; the problem with databases is the very way that the market deals with personal information\u2014a problem in the nature of the market it- self that prevents fair and voluntary information transactions .

For example , Amazon.com \u2019 s book recommendation service collects extensive information about a customer \u2019 s taste in books . If the prob- lem is surveillance , then the most obvious solution would be to pro- vide strict limits on Amazon.com \u2019 s collection of information . This solution , however , would curtail much data gathering that is neces- sary for business in today \u2019 s society and that is put to bene\ufb01cial uses . Indeed , many Amazon.com customers , myself included , \ufb01nd Ama- zon.com \u2019 s book recommendation service to be very helpful . In con- trast , if the problem is understood as I have depicted it , then the problem is not that Amazon is spying on its users or that it can use personal data to induce its customers to buy more books . What is troubling is the unfettered ability of Amazon.com to do whatever it wants with this information . This problem was underscored when Amazon.com abruptly changed its privacy policy to allow the transfer of personal information to third parties in the event Amazon.com sold any of its assets or went bankrupt.54 As a customer , I had no say in this change of policy ; no ability to change it or bargain for additional privacy protection ; and no sense about whether it would apply retroactively to the purchases I already made . And what \u2019 s to prevent Amazon.com in the future from changing its policy once again , per- haps retroactively ? Therefore , privacy regulations should focus on our relationships with bureaucracies , for unless these relationships are restructured , markets in information will not consist of fair , voluntary , and in- formed information transactions . Markets can certainly work to pro- tect privacy , but a precondition of a successful market is establishing rules governing our relationships with bureaucracies .

The question of how to protect privacy was of paramount importance to Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis in \uf731\uf738\uf739\uf730 when they wrote their profoundly in\ufb02uential article , The Right to Pri- vacy . The primary remedy for privacy invasions , they suggested , should be a tort action for damages , and to a limited extent , injunc- tions and criminal penalties.1 Warren and Brandeis \u2019 s conception of privacy problems has been highly in\ufb02uential in the development of privacy law , and I will refer to 93\u25b2 \u25b2 a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y this understanding as the \u201c invasion conception. \u201d Under this concep- tion , privacy is understood as a series of discrete wrongs\u2014inva- sions\u2014to speci\ufb01c individuals . These wrongs occur through the actions of particular wrongdoers . The injury is experienced by the in- dividuals who are wronged . For example , a privacy violation that would \ufb01t well into the invasion conception is a newspaper publishing a photograph of a person in the nude without that person \u2019 s consent . There is a particular wrongdoer ( the newspaper ) that engages in a particular action ( publishing the photograph ) which causes harm to a particular individual . This harm consists of mental distress and any consequent physical or mental impairment . Under the invasion conception , privacy protections safeguard against these wrongs to individuals . Protection consists of rights and remedies for each instance of harm , and in certain cases , criminal punishments for the wrongdoers . Thus , the invasion conception is re- active . It waits for harms to materialize in concrete form and then re- acts . The invasion conception works to prevent future harms through the deterrent e\ufb00ects of civil liability and criminal penalties . Another aspect of the invasion conception is that it often views pri- vacy protections in the form of rights possessed and remedied at the initiative of the individuals whose privacy has been invaded . The value of protecting privacy is measured in terms of the value of pre- venting harm to the individual . In the words of one court , \u201c [ p ] rivacy is inherently personal . The right to privacy recognizes the sovereignty of the individual. \u201d 2 According to the Restatement of Torts : \u201c The right protected by the action for invasion of privacy is a personal right , pe- culiar to the individual whose privacy is invaded. \u201d 3 Under this view , privacy is enforced by allowing individuals to seek remedies for pri- vacy invasions . The privacy torts are designed to redress speci\ufb01c harms . In many cases , however , damages are likely to be small , thus creating little in- centive to sue . The result is that"}]}

It aims to deter crime by establishing penalties for privacy inva- sions . Criminal law is often reactive , responding to crime with punishments after its occurrence . Frequently , criminal law fails to be proactive in preventing crime . Although criminal law certainly works to deter crime , some crimes are di\ufb03cult to deter . Criminal law can only reach a certain level of deterrence , which can be limited by di\ufb03- culties in catching and prosecuting the perpetrators . Crimes involv- ing the use and dissemination of personal information present complicated enforcement problems , since these crimes can occur from anywhere in the world , are easy to conceal , and take a long time to detect . Although the invasion conception works for a number of privacy problems , not all privacy problems are the same , and many do not \ufb01t well into this model . In particular , the invasion conception does not adequately account for many of the privacy problems arising to- day . The problems of digital dossiers do not consist merely of a se- ries of isolated and discrete invasions or harms , but are systemic in nature , caused by a particular social or legal structure . Moreover , as I explained earlier , the aggregation e\ufb00ect complicates the applica- tion of tort law in speci\ufb01c cases . In isolation , a particular piece of information may not be very invasive of one \u2019 s privacy . But when pieces of information are combined , they may form a detailed ac- count of an individual . The whole may be greater than the sum of the parts . Further , the exchange of personal information between businesses can not be readily analogized to the widespread disclosure of infor- mation by the media . When companies buy and sell information , they disclose it to only a few other entities . How are damages to be as- sessed ? These harms do not translate well to tort law or criminal law , which focus on isolated actors and address harms individually rather than collectively . The traditional view of privacy harms pervades much of the law of information privacy . Courts often look for speci\ufb01c injuries . For example , in U.S. West , Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission , the court of appeals struck down FCC regulations requiring that \u25b2 a r"}]}

The court reasoned that the governmental interest in pro- tecting privacy wasn \u2019 t \u201c substantial \u201d because the government failed to \u201c show that the dissemination of the information desired to be kept private would in\ufb02ict speci\ufb01c and signi\ufb01cant harm on individuals , such as undue embarrassment or ridicule , intimidation or harass- ment , or misappropriation of sensitive personal information for the purposes of assuming another \u2019 s identity. \u201d 4 First Amendment scholar Eugene Volokh epitomizes this view when he writes : [ M ] any of the proposals to restrict communication of consumer transactional data would apply far beyond a narrow core of highly private information , and would cover all transactional in- formation , such as the car , house , food , or clothes one buys . I don \u2019 t deny that many people may \ufb01nd such speech vaguely omi- nous and would rather that it not take place , and I acknowledge that some people get extremely upset about it . . . . If such rela- tively modest o\ufb00ense or annoyance is enough to justify speech restrictions , then the compelling interest bar has fallen quite low.5 This way of viewing the harm to privacy fails to acknowledge the larger systemic problems involved with information \ufb02ow . As I have argued in chapter \uf733 , the growing use and dissemination of personal information creates a Kafkaesque world of bureaucracy , where we are increasingly powerless and vulnerable , where personal information is not only outside our control but also is subjected to a bureaucratic process that is itself not adequately controlled . This generalized harm already exists ; we need not wait for speci\ufb01c abuses to occur . Enforcement at the initiative of the individual also creates di\ufb03cul- ties . Arguing from the invasion conception , Fred Cate contends that although people claim they desire more privacy , their actions illus- trate that they do not want to sacri\ufb01ce much time or energy in obtain- ing it.6 The goal of the law , says Cate , should be to assist those who want to protect their privacy rather than to thrust a uniform wall of privacy around everyone : \u201c The law should serve as a gap-\ufb01ller , facili- tating individual action in those situations in which the lack of com- a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y \u25b2 petition has interfered with private privacy protection. \u201d 7 Further- more , according to Cate ,"}]}

Individual remedies are only e\ufb00ective to the extent that individuals have power to exercise them . In the face of forces created by social structure , individual remedies are often pow- erless . A person may have the legal opportunity to bargain to modify a contract , lease , or employment agreement or to sue for redress if wronged . But unless that person has the knowledge and ability to bargain or to sue , the opportunities are often not very empowering . Rights to consent to the collection of data lack much meaning if peo- ple can be readily pressured , misled , or coerced into relinquishing their information.9 Additionally , the invasion conception \u2019 s focus on privacy invasions as harms to speci\ufb01c individuals often overlooks the fact that certain privacy problems are structural\u2014they a\ufb00ect not only particular indi- viduals but society as a whole . Privacy can not merely be enforced at the initiative of particular individuals . Privacy , as Paul Schwartz con- tends , should be viewed as a \u201c constitutive value \u201d because \u201c access to personal information and limits on it help form the society in which we live and shape our individual identities. \u201d 10 Since certain privacy problems are structural in nature , they a\ufb00ect more than speci\ufb01c ag- grieved individuals . As data privacy expert Spiros Simitis aptly ob- serves , \u201c privacy considerations no longer arise out of particular individual problems ; rather , they express con\ufb02icts a\ufb00ecting every- one. \u201d 11 Architecture . If we look at privacy more as an aspect of social and legal structure , then we begin to see that certain types of privacy harms are systemic and structural in nature , and we need to protect against them di\ufb00erently . The concept of \u201c architecture \u201d is useful for understanding how cer- tain privacy problems should be understood and dealt with . The term \u201c architecture \u201d typically refers to the design of spaces\u2014of buildings or \u25b2 a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y cities . I use the term architecture in a broader way , similar to Lawrence Lessig and Joel Reidenberg , who contend that architecture does not merely describe the design of physical structures , but can be constructed through computer code.12 Our environment is not only shaped spatially by the architecture of buildings and the layout of cities , but by the design of information systems . This architecture has similar e\ufb00ects as spatial design"}]}

The Internet itself has a design , one that a\ufb00ects the way people communicate , the way data is transferred , and the extent to which people can be anonymous . Architecture creates certain psychological and social e\ufb00ects.13 Ac- cording to Neal Katyal , physical architecture a\ufb00ects human conduct.14 Architecture can structure spaces to \u201c facilitate unplanned social in- teraction \u201d by positioning door entrances so they face each other.15 Ar- chitecture also alters perception by its aesthetic design , by what it expresses . Frank Lloyd Wright observed that architecture involves \u201c making structure express ideas. \u201d 16 By in\ufb02uencing human behavior , attitudes , thoughts , and interactions , architecture plays a profound role in the structuring of society . One of the ways in which architecture a\ufb00ects society is by enhanc- ing or diminishing privacy . Recall from chapter \uf733 Jeremy Bentham \u2019 s design for a prison , the Panopticon . The Panopticon demonstrates how architecture can shape the very constitution of society by a\ufb00ect- ing privacy . Through its design with a central observation tower , the Panopticon creates a constant fear of observation , resulting in in- creased obedience and discipline . As Michel Foucault observes , \u201c without any physical instrument other than architecture and geom- etry , [ the Panopticon ] acts directly on individuals. \u201d 17 Unlike dun- geons , which served \u201c to enclose , to deprive of light and to hide , \u201d the Panopticon achieves control through visibility.18 The Panopticon is a form of architecture that inhibits freedom ; it is an architecture of so- a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y \u25b2 cial control and discipline . For Foucault , the Panopticon is not merely consigned to physical structures such as prisons ; it is an ar- chitecture that is increasingly built into the entire social structure.19 Panoptic architecture is increasingly employed in modern society , in both physical and non-physical forms . Surveillance cameras are a prime example . Since \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf734 , Britain has overseen city streets through the use of about \uf732.\uf735 million surveillance cameras monitored by closed circuit television ( CCTV ) .20 It is virtually impossible to walk the streets of London without being captured on camera numerous times throughout the day .

Panoptic architecture , and the architecture Lessig and Reidenberg discuss , are \u201c architectures of control , \u201d 21 for they function to exercise greater dominion over individuals . Lessig observes that \u201c [ c ] yberspace does not guarantee its own freedom but instead carries an extraordi- nary potential for control. \u201d 22 Lessig is responding to the early buzz about the Internet , which was hailed as a place of unprecedented freedom , a freewheeling and uninhibited world . Although the Inter- net certainly has the potential to be a realm of liberty , Lessig demon- strates that it can be regulated\u2014through law and computer code . People can be traced ; speech can be censored ; access to information can be limited ; anonymity can be restricted . Therefore , the Internet has the potential to become a realm of comprehensive control . But beyond control , architecture can function in other problem- atic ways . In addition to architectures of control , we are seeing the development of what I call \u201c architectures of vulnerability. \u201d Architec- ture can create a world where people are vulnerable to signi\ufb01cant harm and are helpless to do anything about it . Architectures of vul- nerability function di\ufb00erently than architectures of control . Architec- tures of control are ways in which people are limited in their actions and their freedom , where they are pressed into conformity to an- other \u2019 s will . In contrast , architectures of vulnerability make people weaker , expose them to a host of dangers , and take away their power . Whereas architectures of control are central to Big Brother , architec- tures of vulnerability pervade the world depicted by Kafka . As I will discuss later , the rapid rise in identity theft is caused by architectures of vulnerability . \u25b2 a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y For problems that are architectural , the solutions should also be architectural . Privacy must be protected by reforming the architec- ture , which involves restructuring our relationships with businesses and the government . In other words , the law should regulate the rela- tionships . As I discussed earlier in this book , our relationships with businesses and the government are becoming more bureaucratic in nature , and it is this general development that must be addressed . Thus , an architectural solution goes beyond treating the troublesome symptoms that materialize from the use of digital dossiers . The law often works at the surface of the problems , dealing with the overt abuses and injuries that may arise in speci\ufb01c instances .

Architecture protects privacy di\ufb00erently than individual remedies . It is more proactive than reactive ; it involves creating structures to prevent harms from arising rather than merely providing remedies when harms occur . The invasion conception enforces privacy through legal remedies employed at the initiative of individuals and penalties to speci\ufb01c wrongdoers . Architectural remedies are more systemic in nature , and they work by altering social structure to make it harder for torts and crimes to occur . As Neal Katyal persuasively ar- gues , architecture deals with crime di\ufb00erently than criminal penal- ties ; it can prevent crime , facilitate the capture of criminals , and can even \u201c shape individuals \u2019 attitudes toward lawbreaking. \u201d 23 I am not contending that a\ufb00ording individuals with a cause of ac- tion or a remedy for privacy invasions is completely ine\ufb00ective . In- deed , individual remedies must be a component of any architecture . However , individual remedies alone are often not su\ufb03cient , for their viability and e\ufb00ectiveness depends upon the architecture in which they are embedded . I am also not arguing that the invasion conception is incorrect and should be abandoned .

In fact , understanding pri- vacy problems with the notion of architecture is not in con\ufb02ict with the view of privacy articulated by Warren and Brandeis . A critical part of Warren and Brandeis \u2019 s argument was the importance of the law \u2019 s ability to respond to new problems . Today , we face a host of di\ufb00erent privacy problems . We need to recognize their di\ufb00erences and adapt the law to grapple with them rather than continue to view them through old lenses and attempt to resolve them in the same manner as other problems . Warren and Brandeis wrote long before the rise of massive record systems and information networks . The problems created by the growing accumulation , dissemination , and networking of personal information are better understood architecturally than under the in- vasion conception . Viewing these problems through architecture re- veals that the problems are caused in a di\ufb00erent manner than we might have originally supposed . It recognizes harm within design and structure .

Rather , the protec- tion of privacy depends upon an architecture that structures power , a regulatory framework that governs how information is dissemi- nated , collected , and networked . We need to focus on controlling power . Often , new technology is introduced without adequate con- trols , and as a result , it creates vulnerability and engenders trouble- some shifts in power , even if the proposed uses of the technology do not seem immediately troubling and even if the threat of abuse is not imminent . The protection of privacy does not mean an all-or-noth- ing tradeo\ufb00 between the total restriction of information gathering versus the complete absence of regulation . Many privacy problems can be ameliorated if information uses are carefully and thoughtfully controlled .

At present , the collectors and users of our data are often not accountable to us . A company can collect a person \u2019 s data without ever contacting that person , without that person ever \ufb01nding out about it . The relationship is akin to the relationship between strangers\u2014with one very important di\ufb00erence : One of the strangers knows a lot about the other and often has the power to use this infor- mation to a\ufb00ect the other \u2019 s life . But the stranger with the knowledge doesn \u2019 t have many obligations to the other . At other times , we estab- lish a relationship with a company , a bank , or another institution . We might buy a product online or open up an account and invest money . We are no longer strangers , but the quality of our relationship is often not dramatically improved . Companies collect and maintain our in- formation ; they often use it for a myriad of new purposes ; and they are frequently careless about the security of our data .

Indeed , the patient-physician relationship has been likened by courts to a \ufb01duciary one.24 A \ufb01duciary relationship is a cen- tral facet of the law of trusts . Trustees stand in a \ufb01duciary relationship to bene\ufb01ciaries of the trust . The trustee has been entrusted with the bene\ufb01ciary \u2019 s money , and because of this position of special trust , the trustee owes certain special duties to the bene\ufb01ciary.25 Justice Ben- jamin Cardozo , then writing for the Court of Appeals of New York , de- scribed \ufb01duciary duties in a famous passage : Many forms of conduct permissible in a workaday world for those acting at arm \u2019 s length , are forbidden to those bound by \ufb01duciary ties . A trustee is held to something stricter than the a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y \u25b2 morals of the market place . Not honesty alone , but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive , is then the standard of behavior.26 The types of relationships that qualify as \ufb01duciary ones are not \ufb01xed in stone . As one court has noted , courts \u201c have carefully refrained from de\ufb01ning instances of \ufb01duciary relations in such a manner that other and perhaps new cases might be excluded. \u201d 27 Examples of rec- ognized \ufb01duciary relationships include those between stockbrokers and clients , lawyers and clients , physicians and patients , parents and children , corporate o\ufb03cers and shareholders , and insurance compa- nies and their customers.28 Fiduciaries have a duty to disclose personal interests that could a\ufb00ect their professional judgment as well as a duty of con\ufb01dentiality.29 For example , doctors who disclose a patient \u2019 s con\ufb01dential medical in- formation have been successfully sued by patients for breach of con\ufb01dentiality.30 Likewise , banks and schools have been held to be obliged to keep personal information con\ufb01dential.31 I posit that the law should hold that companies collecting and us- ing our personal information stand in a \ufb01duciary relationship with us . This is a radical proposal . Although the concept of a \ufb01duciary re- lationship is an open-ended and developing one , the concept has not been extended nearly as far as I propose . Generally , courts examine a number of factors to determine the existence of a \ufb01duciary relation- ship : \u201c [ T ] he degree of kinship of the parties ; the disparity in age , health , and mental condition ; education and business experience be- tween the parties ; and the extent to which the allegedly subservient party entrusted the handling of . . . business a\ufb00airs to the other and reposed faith and con\ufb01dence in [ that person or entity ] . \u201d 32 Most of the factors look at disparities in power"}]}

The last factor , however , understands the rela- tionship as one in which something has been explicitly entrusted to the trustee . This will work in the context of companies that we do business with , for we entrust them with our personal data .

We don \u2019 t entrust anything to these companies ; they often take our data surreptitiously , without our consent . Nevertheless , the law is \ufb02exible and in the past has re- sponded to new situations . The law should grow to respond here , since all of the other factors for recognizing a \ufb01duciary relationship seem to counsel so strongly for the need to impose \ufb01duciary obliga- tions for the collectors and users of our personal information . If our relationships with the collectors and users of our personal data are rede\ufb01ned as \ufb01duciary ones , then this would be the start of a signi\ufb01cant shift in the way the law understands their obligations to us .

Understood broadly , the Fair Informa- tion Practices establish an architecture that alters the power dynamic between individuals and the various bureaucracies that process their personal information . The Fair Information Practices focus on two general concerns : participation and responsibility . They aim to struc- ture the information economy so that people can participate mean- ingfully in the collection and use of their personal information . This does not necessarily mean that people are a\ufb00orded dominion over their personal information ; rather , people are to be kept informed about the information gathered about them and the purposes of its use ; and people must have some say in the way their information is processed . In other words , the Fair Information Practices aim to in- crease individual involvement in personal information systems . Additionally , the Fair Information Practices bring information pro- cessing under better control . Currently , information processing is out of control . Companies collecting and using personal information are often doing so in careless ways with little concern for the welfare of the individuals to whom the information pertains . The Fair Informa- tion Practices recognize that personal data users have special respon- sibilities and that they must be regulated in order to ensure that they maintain accurate and secure records and use and disseminate infor- mation responsibly . Unfortunately , in the United States the Fair Information Practices have only been selectively incorporated into various statutes in a lim- ited number of contexts . A more comprehensive incorporation of the Fair Information Practices would go far toward addressing the privacy problem as I have characterized it . Participation : Opting-Out versus Opting-In . The current self-regulatory and legislative solution of enabling people to opt-out of having their \u25b2 a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y data collected or disseminated is ine\ufb00ectual .

Providing people with opt-out rights and pri- vacy policies does little to give individuals much control over their in- formation . Regulation mandating that consumers opt-in rather than opt-out will more e\ufb00ectively control the \ufb02ow of information between unequal parties . Under a system where individuals opt-in , the default rule is that personal information can not be collected or used about an individual unless the individual provides consent . As Je\ufb00 Sovern contends , an opt-in system will place the incentive on entities that use personal information to \u201c make it as easy as possible for con- sumers to consent to the use of their personal information. \u201d 37 There- fore , the law should require companies to adopt an opt-in system rather than an opt-out system . Even with an opt-in system , steps must be taken to ensure that consent amounts to more than a \u201c notice and choice \u201d system , which , as Marc Rotenberg argues , \u201c imagines the creation of perfect market conditions where consumers are suddenly negotiating over a range of uses for personal information. \u201d 38 Thus , e\ufb00ective privacy regulation must legally require an opt-in system which contains a meaningful range of choices as well as addresses inequalities in knowledge and power and other impediments to voluntary and informed consent . For example , inequalities in knowledge\u2014the fact that companies know how they might use data whereas people have little awareness of these plans\u2014could be addressed by limiting such future uses of personal data without \ufb01rst obtaining people \u2019 s consent . Limits on the Use of Data . A critical step toward addressing the prob- lems of digital dossiers is providing limits on the use of data . Interna- tionally , the OECD Guidelines provide that \u201c [ p ] ersonal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be used , and , to the ex- tent necessary for those purposes , should be accurate , complete , and kept up-to-date. \u201d 39 In \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf736 , the European Union issued the European Community Directive on Data Protection , which outlines the basic principles for privacy legislation for European Union member coun- a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y \u25b2 tries . The Directive provides for a comprehensive protection of per- sonal information maintained by a broad range of entities . This om- nibus approach exists in stark contrast to the United States \u2019 approach , which regulates privacy \u201c sectorally \u201d in various narrow con- texts.40 Although the Directive is far from perfect , it recognizes some of the dimensions of the problem that are neglected by U.S. privacy law"}]}

For example , Article \uf731\uf735 provides : Member States shall grant the right to every person not to be subject to a decision which produces legal e\ufb00ects concerning him or signi\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ects him and which is based solely on au- tomated processing of data intended to evaluate certain per- sonal aspects relating to him , such as his performance at work , creditworthiness , reliability , conduct , etc.41 Further , Article \uf738 prohibits , subject to a number of necessary ex- ceptions , \u201c the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin , political opinions , religious or philosophical beliefs , trade- union membership , and the processing of data concerning health or sex life. \u201d 42 These two provisions of the Directive limit the ways per- sonal information can be used to make important decisions a\ufb00ecting people \u2019 s lives . Enforcement . The Fair Information Practices are broad principles , and they do not specify how they are to be carried out in practice or enforced . As I discussed earlier , individual remedies can only go so far . Of course , individual remedies are important , and people should be able to sue when injured by companies that fail to follow the Fair Information Practices . But with many of the new types of architec- tural harms I described\u2014such as making people more vulnerable to fraud and identity theft\u2014damages will be di\ufb03cult to calculate . When a person actually su\ufb00ers from identity theft , it is easy to comprehend the harm . When a person is made more vulnerable\u2014such as being exposed to a greater risk of injury but not yet actually injured\u2014it is harder to establish damages because one can \u2019 t point to concrete eco- nomic loss or physical pain and su\ufb00ering . Nevertheless , increased vulnerability is a palpable harm\u2014just as weakening a person \u2019 s \u25b2 a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y immune system would be , or disabling her home security system . Part of the challenge for law is to begin to recognize the harms cre- ated by increased vulnerability and powerlessness . But until the law does this , enforcement must also occur through the work of govern- ment agencies tasked with policing the corporate world of informa- tion networking . Just as the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulates food and drugs , just as the Securities and Exchange Com- mission ( SEC ) regulates the securities markets , we need a federal agency to regulate the collection and use of personal information.43 As I discussed in chapter \uf734 , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has started to undertake this role , but it has a long way to go . The FTC must receive expanded jurisdiction and resources"}]}

In a handful of cases thus far , the FTC has preemptively brought actions against companies for maintaining shoddy security even before in- formation was leaked or obtained improperly .

Reconceptualizing Identity Theft Thus far , what I have said has been relatively abstract . In the remain- der of this chapter , I will provide a speci\ufb01c demonstration of these points through the example of one of the most rapidly growing and troubling problems of the information economy\u2014the problem of identity theft .

An identity thief uses the victim \u2019 s information for several years to buy and sell property , open bank accounts , establish phone service , and so on.46 Pursuant to a Florida warrant based on the crimi- nal conduct of the identity thief , the victim is arrested in California and imprisoned for over a week . The victim also has civil judgments issued against him.47 The identity of a retired \uf737\uf734-year-old man is stolen . Debts continue to amass on his credit reports . Although the victim lives in Maryland , a Texas bank issues a car loan to the identity thief in Texas.48 The vic- tim continually \ufb01ghts to have the debts removed from his credit re- ports , but he is told to take up the issues with the creditors who claim that the debts are legitimate . Even after debts are removed , they reap- pear on his credit reports because a di\ufb00erent collection agency re- places them.49 These are examples of what has come to be called \u201c identity theft , \u201d which is a problem involving personal information . As de\ufb01ned by the U.S. General Accounting O\ufb03ce , \u201c identity theft or identity fraud gen- erally involves \u2018 stealing \u2019 another person \u2019 s personal identifying infor- mation . . . and then using that information to fraudulently establish \u25b2 a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y credit , run up debt , or take over existing \ufb01nancial accounts. \u201d 50 Identity theft is not the same as ordinary credit card fraud , where a thief steals and uses a person \u2019 s credit card . In identity theft , the culprit obtains personal information and uses it in a variety of fraudulent ways to im- personate the victim . The thief gathers personal information from database companies and public records , or by stealing wallets , pilfer- ing mail , or rooting through trash to \ufb01nd data on discarded docu- ments.51 Identity theft is the most rapidly growing type of white-collar crim- inal activity.52 According to an FTC estimate in September \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733 , \u201c al- most \uf731\uf730 million Americans have discovered that they were the victim of some form of ID theft within the past year. \u201d 53 Identity theft can be a harrowing experience . According to estimates , a victim typically spends over two years and close to \uf732\uf730\uf730 hours to repair the damage that identity theft causes.54 Victims often spend thousands of dollars to remedy the harm , and many experience great anxiety.55 They have di\ufb03culty getting a loan , securing a mortgage , obtaining a security clearance , or even being hired for a job.56 And victims are sometimes arrested based on warrants for the crimes of the identity thieves.57 Identity theft"}]}

Credit reporting agencies construct dossiers about us to report our \ufb01nancial status to creditors . Without these reports , people can \u2019 t ob- tain loans , mortgages , or leases . Personal information is also used to establish accounts with merchants , ISPs , cable companies , phone companies , and so on . The identity thief not only pilfers victims \u2019 personal information , but also pollutes their dossiers by adding false information , such as unpaid debts , tra\ufb03c violations , parking tickets , and arrests . The harm of identity theft is not solely \ufb01nancial ; it can seep into a person \u2019 s everyday life . The victim can not readily recover the personal informa- tion in the way that stolen property can be recovered . The victim must constantly defend against the identity thief \u2019 s next move .

Identity Theft and the Invasion Conception . Thus far , the law has viewed identity theft under the invasion conception\u2014as a harm to individu- als by criminals . Identity theft unquestionably harms individuals and certainly involves criminals . Therefore , it is no surprise that identity theft is viewed under the invasion conception and that the solutions to identity theft emerge from this model . As I will argue later , this model is deeply \ufb02awed and as a result , its solutions are ine\ufb00ective . In \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738 , Congress passed the Identity Theft and Assumption Deter- rence Act , which erected a comprehensive penal regime for identity theft.58 Subsequently , the vast majority of states have passed laws to criminalize identity theft.59 Thus , it is only recently that policymakers have turned their attention to identity theft , and the overwhelming approach is to classify identity theft as a species of crime and to focus on the actions of these criminals . There are several problems with viewing identity theft exclusively in this manner . First , law enforcement agencies have thus far not de- voted adequate resources toward investigating and prosecuting iden- tity theft cases . In a U.S. General Accounting O\ufb03ce survey of \uf731\uf730 states , o\ufb03cials admitted that"}]}

Additionally , the survey reported , \u201c [ i ] dentity theft cases require highly trained investigators , require longer-than- usual e\ufb00orts , and often end without an arrest. \u201d Identity theft often oc- curs across di\ufb00erent jurisdictions , and law enforcement o\ufb03cials \u201c sometimes tend to view identity theft as being \u2018 someone else \u2019 s prob- lem. \u2019 \u201d As a result , most identity thefts remain unsolved.60 Research \ufb01rm Gartner , Inc. estimates that less than \uf731 in \uf737\uf730\uf730 instances of iden- tity theft result in a conviction.61 Second , victims experience great di\ufb03culty in obtaining redress for identity theft . Victims are often unaware that their identities have been stolen until long after the identity theft has begun . A report based on victim surveys estimates that it takes victims over a year to discover that they have been victimized.62 According to FTC esti- mates , \uf732\uf730 percent of identity theft victims don \u2019 t learn of the theft until \u25b2 a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y two years later.63 One tip-o\ufb00 that a person is a victim of identity theft is an unusual item on a credit report . The identity thief often takes out loans and uses lines of credit which the thief never pays back . These delinquencies show up on the victim \u2019 s credit report , and destroy the victim \u2019 s credit rating . Unfortunately , the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ,64 which regulates credit reporting agencies , fails to provide people with adequate resources to discover that they are being vic- timized or repair the damage done by identity theft . Although the FCRA permits individuals to contest the accuracy of information in their credit histories65 and enables individuals to sue to collect dam- ages for violations of the Act,66 these rights often are ine\ufb00ectual . One problem is that people often are unaware of the information their credit reports contain . To obtain such information , people must re- quest a copy of their credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies\u2014Experian , Equifax , and Trans Union . And if indi- viduals want to ensure that their credit reports remain accurate , they must request reports regularly . Credit reporting agencies have a duty to investigate consumer dis- putes with the accuracy of their reports , but this often is ine\ufb00ective in cases of identity theft .

The victim has no right to a hearing on the accuracy of the information re- quested. \u201d Moreover , the \u201c FTC seldom acts on the complaint of a sin- gle customer. \u201d 67 The FCRA does not allow people to sue for \u201c defamation , invasion of privacy , or negligence \u201d when the credit reporting agency discloses false information or a creditor reports false information to a credit re- porting agency unless the information is \u201c furnished with malice or willful intent to injure such consumer. \u201d Instead , the FCRA provides a cause of action for negligently failing to comply with its provisions , but a victim must bring an action within two years \u201c from the date on which the liability arises. \u201d 68 In TRW , Inc. v. Andrews , the Supreme Court a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y \u25b2 held that the two-year statute of limitations period begins to run when a violation occurs , even if the plainti\ufb00 remains unaware of it.69 In December \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733 , Congress passed a law , called the Fair and Ac- curate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) , that revised the FCRA.70 The FACTA makes several improvements to the FCRA . It overturns An- drews and expands the statute of limitations to \ufb01ve years from the vi- olation or two years following the discovery of the violation . A person can ask a credit reporting agency to place a \u201c fraud alert \u201d in her \ufb01le , and the agency must contact all the other credit reporting agencies to do the same . The Act also makes it easier for identity theft victims to obtain records from companies where the thief opened accounts or purchased goods . People can request a free credit report each year from all of the national credit reporting agencies . The Act provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of o\ufb00ers of prescreened credit . However , the Act is still moored in the invasion conception . The law does not allow individuals enough involvement in the uses and dissemination of their personal information to quickly discover that they are victims of identity theft or to obtain redress after identity theft occurs . The FACTA makes it slightly easier for victims to repair the damage from identity theft , but this is akin to a better bandage .

The states , not the federal government , had been providing stronger and more e\ufb00ective protection .

Fred Cate argues that identity theft could be greatly cur- tailed if people exercised more care over their data : Despite all the bills introduced to combat the theft of identity , in- dividual action may provide the best defense : keeping a close watch on account activity ; reporting suspicious or unfamiliar transactions promptly ; properly destroying commercial solicita- tions ; storing valuable documents securely ; protecting account names and passwords ; and never disclosing personal informa- tion to unknown callers.71 A report by the FDIC suggests several tips for people to \u201c minimize \u201d the risk of identity theft : Pay attention to your billing cycles . Guard your mail from theft . Do not give out personal information . Keep items with personal information in a safe place . Give your SSN only when absolutely necessary . Don \u2019 t carry your SSN card ; leave it in a secure place . Order a copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies every year.72 The general advice is that if people take a number of steps , identity theft will be minimized . However , personal data is often collected un- wittingly , without consent ; SSNs are frequently used , and refusal to give out one \u2019 s SSN results in considerable inconvenience ; and many people can not even name the three major credit reporting agencies , let alone request a copy of their credit reports .

Of course , identity thieves should be prosecuted and people should avoid being careless with their data . The law has signi- \ufb01cant room to improve in prosecuting identity theft . But these solu- tions fail to address the foundations of the problem . Identity Theft as Architecture . The underlying cause of identity theft is an architecture that makes us vulnerable to such crimes and unable to adequately repair the damage . This architecture is not created by identity thieves ; rather , it is exploited by them . It is an architecture of vulnerability , one where personal information is not protected with adequate security , where identity thieves have easy access to data and the ability to use it in detrimental ways . We are increasingly living with digital dossiers about our lives , and these dossiers are not con- trolled by us but by various entities , such as private-sector companies and the government . These dossiers play a profound role in our exis- tence in modern society . The identity thief taps into these dossiers and uses them , manipulates them , and pollutes them . The identity thief \u2019 s ability to so easily access and use our personal data stems from an architecture that does not provide adequate security to our per- sonal information and that does not a\ufb00ord us with a su\ufb03cient degree of participation in its collection , dissemination , and use . Conse- quently , it is di\ufb03cult for the victim to \ufb01gure out what is going on and how to remedy the situation . The traditional legal view of identity theft fails to address this ar- chitecture , for it focuses on identity theft as a series of discrete in- stances of crime rather than as a larger problem about the way our personal information is handled . Even the term \u201c identity theft \u201d views it as an instance of crime\u2014a \u201c theft \u201d rather than the product of inade- quate security .

Indeed , for \u25b2 a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y many years , the Social Security card stated that it was \u201c not for identification. \u201d 75 However , over time , numerous federal agencies began using the SSN for identi\ufb01cation , as did state and local govern- ments , schools , banks , hospitals , and other private-sector entities.76 In the early \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730s , the growing uses of the SSN raised serious con- cerns that the SSN would become a de facto universal identi\ufb01er.77 In the Privacy Act of \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf734 , Congress partially responded to these con- cerns by prohibiting government agencies from denying any right , bene\ufb01t , or privilege merely because an individual refused to disclose her SSN . However , the Privacy Act did not restrict the use of SSNs by the private sector . The use of the SSN continued to escalate after the Privacy Act . As one commentator has observed , \u201c governmental dissemination of personal identifying numbers is still widespread , and limits on pri- vate actors are also virtually nonexistent. \u201d 78 Today , the SSN functions in the United States as a de facto identi\ufb01er , and there is scant protec- tion on its use . SSNs are often widely available . Schools frequently use student SSNs as student identi\ufb01ers , which makes student SSNs avail- able to a large number of university personnel . States often place SSNs on driver \u2019 s licenses , which exposes SSNs to anyone who checks a driver \u2019 s license for identi\ufb01cation . Additionally , SSNs are requested on a wide variety of applications and forms , such as employment ap- plications , hospital admittance forms , college applications , video store membership applications , and credit card applications . SSNs are used as passwords to obtain access to a host of personal records from banks , investment companies , schools , hospitals , doc- tors , and so on.79 The SSN is a powerful number , for with it a person can open and close accounts , change addresses , obtain loans , access personal information , make \ufb01nancial transactions , and more . In short , the SSN functions as a magic key that can unlock vast stores of records as well as \ufb01nancial accounts , making it the identity thief \u2019 s best tool .

SSNs are harvested by database \ufb01rms from a number of public and non-public sources , such as court records or credit reports . It is currently legal for private \ufb01rms to sell or disclose SSNs . SSNs and other personal information that assists identity thieves can be obtained from public records or the database companies that market personal data mined from pub- lic records.80 SSNs are in fact required by law to be publicly disclosed in bankruptcy records.81 Identity thieves thus can plunder public records , which are increasingly being made readily accessible on the Internet , for personal information to carry out their crimes . For ex- ample , recently the clerk of courts for Hamilton County , Ohio placed the county \u2019 s public records on the Internet . From a speeding ticket placed on the website , an identity thief accessed a victim \u2019 s SSN , ad- dress , birth date , signature , and other personal information and opened up credit card accounts in the victim \u2019 s name.82 Further , iden- tity thieves can obtain SSNs along with a detailed dossier about their victims simply by paying a small fee to various database companies.83 The problem of identity theft also stems from the private sector \u2019 s inadequate security measures in handling personal information . Companies lack adequate ways of controlling access to records and accounts in a person \u2019 s name , and numerous companies engage in the common practice of using SSNs , mother \u2019 s maiden names , and ad- dresses for access to account information.84 Additionally , creditors give out credit and establish new accounts if the applicant supplies a name , SSN , and address . The credit reporting system also employs inadequate precautions to ensure against inaccuracies in credit reports and improper access to the system . Credit reporting agencies don \u2019 t work for the individuals they report on ; rather , they are paid by creditors . Even though the FCRA gives people certain rights with regard to credit reporting agen- cies , there is still a signi\ufb01cant lack of accountability because credit re- porting agencies have no incentive to compete for the business of those on whom they report .

The problem is that we have so little participation in the use of our per- sonal data combined with the fact that it \ufb02ows so insecurely and care- lessly without su\ufb03cient control . The harm is not simply measured in the overt instances of identity theft and abuse , but in the fact that we are made more vulnerable to a series of errors , abuses , and dangers . Indeed , with ever more frequency , we are hearing stories about se- curity glitches and other instances of personal data being leaked and abused . For example , in \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732 , identity thieves improperly used Ford Motor Credit Company \u2019 s code to access the credit \ufb01les of \uf731\uf733 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 of Ford \u2019 s customers , which were maintained by Experian , a major credit reporting agency.87 Citibank employed a database marketing com- pany to collect the email addresses of its credit card customers and send them emails o\ufb00ering them access to their \ufb01nancial informa- tion.88 This was done without verifying whether the email addresses actually belonged to the particular customers.89 The problems of information handling are most vividly illustrated by an incident involving Princeton University o\ufb03cials who improp- erly accessed personal information in a Yale University database . Yale established a website enabling undergraduate applicants to \ufb01nd out whether they had been accepted or denied admission.90 The website invited students to enter additional information , such as their inter- ests and hobbies.91 To access the website , the students were asked their name , birth date , and SSN.92 However , in April \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732 , a Princeton admissions o\ufb03cial accessed certain applicants \u2019 accounts on Yale \u2019 s website by using their SSNs.93 After discovering the unauthorized ac- cess by Princeton , Yale reported the incident to the FBI.94 Although the shady actions of the Princeton o\ufb03cial grabbed the most atten- tion , the problem was created by Yale \u2019 s inept security measures , ones that resemble in many ways those used by companies that hold even more sensitive personal data .

Identity theft does not merely hap- pen ; rather , it is manufactured by a legally constructed architecture . Further , the architecture contributes to the harm caused to victims of identity theft . Identity theft plunges people into a bureaucratic nightmare . The identity theft injury to victims is often caused by the frustration and sense of helplessness in attempting to stop and repair the damage caused by the identity thief . Victims experience profound di\ufb03culty in dealing with credit reporting agencies,95 and often \ufb01nd re- curring fraudulent entries on their credit reports even after contact- ing the agencies.96 Identity theft laws do not adequately regulate the bureaucratic system that injures victims . The bureaucracies control- ling personal information are often indi\ufb00erent to the welfare of the individuals to whom the information pertains . Forging a New Architecture If we see the problem architecturally , we see an architecture of vul- nerability , one with large holes , gaps , and weak spots . The harm is caused by the architecture itself . Living in a dilapidated structure\u2014a building with \ufb02imsy walls , no locks , peepholes , inadequate \ufb01re pro- tection , and no emergency exits\u2014is harmful , even without a disaster occurring . Modern society is built on expectations that we will be kept secure , that our money will not be stolen , that our homes will not be invaded , that we will be protected against violence . It is di\ufb03- cult to imagine how we could maintain a free society if we did not have protection against rape , assault , murder , and theft . If these pro- tections are inadequate , there is harm even without being victimized . E\ufb00ective safety is thus partly a design question . According to legal scholar Neal Katyal , physical architecture can be proactive in com- bating crime , for it can prevent crime . For example , \u201c cleanliness and aesthetic appeal \u201d can make people perceive that a place is safe and orderly , and make miscreants less likely to disrupt it.97 In a similar manner , the architecture of information \ufb02ows can be redesigned to prevent identity theft and ameliorate its e\ufb00ects . Identity theft is the product of an architecture that creates vulnerability and insecurity , so \u25b2 a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y the most e\ufb00ective way to combat identity theft is to reconstruct this faulty architecture . But what should an appropriate architecture look like ? Participation and Responsibility . The problem of identity theft can be ad- dressed with an architecture built around"}]}

At the most basic level , the Fair Information Practices place the burden of ad- dressing the identity theft problem on the entities that cause it\u2014 those using personal information . The e\ufb00ectiveness of the Fair Information Practices depends upon how they are applied to particu- lar privacy problems and how they are enforced . In what follows , I will discuss how the two general aims of the Fair Information Practices\u2014 participation and responsibility\u2014can be implemented to help grap- ple with the identity theft problem . First , the architecture should allow for people to have greater par- ticipation in the collection and use of their personal information . Currently , information can be readily disseminated and transferred without a person \u2019 s knowledge or consent . Few requirements exist for how secure information must be kept , and information can be used for whatever purpose the entity possessing it desires . I recommend an architecture that requires companies gathering personal information about people to keep individuals informed about their information . Presently , even with the FCRA , credit report- ing agencies are not responsive enough to the people whose informa- tion they collect and disseminate . The recently passed FACTA allows people to access their credit reports on a yearly basis , but identity theft can occur in the interim and can cause much damage even in a few months . People should be allowed to more regularly access their credit reports for free.98 But LoPucki fears that increasing a person \u2019 s ability to access information held by credit reporting agencies will also increase the identity thief \u2019 s ability to gain access.99 A more radical change in the credit reporting system may be necessary to \ufb01x this di\ufb03culty . An opt-in regime to credit reporting would signi\ufb01cantly curtail problems of improper access to credit records . Currently , credit reporting agencies need not establish any relationship with the people on whom they report . In an opt-in regime , credit reporting a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y \u25b2 agencies would have to contact individuals and would be legally ac- countable for improper access to credit records . Individuals could ac- cess their credit records through passwords or account numbers rather than by supplying SSNs or other personal data . When there is an unusual change in the behavior of a record sub- ject , such as when a person who regularly repays her loans suddenly starts defaulting , credit reporting agencies should notify that person . The architecture should empower people with an easy , quick , and convenient way to challenge inaccuracies about their personal infor- mation as well as fraudulent entries in their credit reports . Disputes can"}]}

If these measures are taken , victims will be able to discover more quickly the existence of identity theft since they will be better in- formed about the data collected about them and how it is being used . The architecture should also be premised on the notion that the collection and use of personal information is an activity that carries duties and responsibilities . The law should establish speci\ufb01c meas- ures of control over entities maintaining systems of personal data . For example , if a company is providing background check information about a person , it should be held responsible for any inaccuracies or de\ufb01ciencies in the information . To establish greater responsibility , the law would regulate private- sector security practices . Minimum security practices must be estab- lished for handling people \u2019 s personal information or accounts . Use of a SSN , mother \u2019 s maiden name , and birth date as the means of gaining access to accounts should be prohibited . Identity theft can be cur- tailed by employing alternative means of identi\ufb01cation , such as pass- words . This solution does not come without di\ufb03culties , as passwords can be easily forgotten or discovered . The use of multiple questions and answers supplied by the customer at the time the account is created can be e\ufb00ective . Questions might include favorite songs , places a per- son has visited , and so on , and these questions must vary from insti- tution to institution . If varying methods of identi\ufb01cation are used , an identity thief will no longer be able to use a few pieces of information \u25b2 a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y to access everything , which will minimize the severity of the impact of identity theft . The thief may be able to access one or two accounts , but not all of them . Unfortunately , so much personal information is already maintained by various database companies that a person \u2019 s answers may exist in these databases . For example , a person might use as a password the name of her college , spouse , pet , or child . Therefore , unique and less common questions and answers will pro- vide better security against identity theft . The possibility that databases will eventually include the types of information that people generally use for these questions demon- strates the importance of thinking architecturally . The problem of identity theft is part of a larger structure in which companies are not e\ufb00ectively regulated in the collection , use , and dissemination of per- sonal information . If database companies are regulated to prohibit the"}]}

Of course , this method of identi\ufb01cation is far from foolproof . But the level of sophistication and di\ufb03culty required to carry out an iden- tity theft would be increased . Additionally , identity theft can be more readily halted . It is currently a di\ufb03cult and cumbersome process to change one \u2019 s SSN.100 And a person can not change her height , birth date , or mother \u2019 s maiden name . Passwords , however , can easily be changed . Thus , once discovered , identity theft will be easier to stop and will not continue long after the victim becomes aware of it . These suggestions pertain to already established accounts . Much identity theft , however , occurs through the identity thief opening up new accounts in the victim \u2019 s name . Currently , it is far too easy to es- tablish a new account through the mail and the Internet.101 Pre-ap- proved credit card applications , for example , enable the recipient to easily establish an account and change addresses . Companies that want to open a new account through the mail should verify an appli- cant \u2019 s address , date of birth , and phone number with a credit report- ing agency , and then send written con\ufb01rmation both to the address listed on the application and to the address that the credit reporting agency has . Further , the company should follow-up by calling the ap- plicant \u2019 s telephone number listed with the credit reporting agency . In the event of any discrepancies in the information held by the credit a r c h i t e c t u r e a n d t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f p r i v a c y \u25b2 reporting agency and the individual , the individual should be noti- \ufb01ed . Of course , this solution would only work well if people had greater participation in the collection and use of their information by credit reporting agencies . Many attempts at identity theft can be halted if creditors take greater care scrutinizing applications . Al- though the identity thief can still intercept the noti\ufb01cation,102 it re- quires additional steps to carry out the identity theft , ones that can increase the chances of the thief getting caught . The solutions just discussed are only recommendations of the types of solutions that can be employed once we recognize that we need to focus on architecture . Viewing identity theft under the inva- sion conception has diverted attention from these architectural con- cerns . If the architecture recognizes the responsibilities of companies maintaining personal data , it will provide a strong incentive for com- panies to devise creative solutions and better security .

These trends together have created a problematic state of a\ufb00airs\u2014a system where the government extracts personal informa- tion from the populace and places it in the public domain , where it is hoarded by private-sector corporations that assemble dossiers on al- most every American citizen . Records from Birth to Death Today , federal , state , and local government entities maintain a smor- gasbord of public records.1 State public records cover one \u2019 s life from birth to death . Birth records can contain one \u2019 s name , date of birth , place of birth , full names and ages of one \u2019 s parents , and mother \u2019 s maiden name.2 In particular , mother \u2019 s maiden names are important because many companies use them as passwords to access more sensitive data . Shortly after birth , the federal government stamps an \u25b2 128 \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m o f p u b l i c r e c o r d s individual with a SSN , which will be used throughout her life to iden- tify her and consolidate records about her . States also maintain other records relating to one \u2019 s personal life , such as records about mar- riages , divorces , and death . These are often referred to collectively as \u201c vital records. \u201d Records of marriages , which are public in most states,3 contain maiden names , the date and place of birth of both spouses , as well as their residential addresses.4 Beyond vital records , states keep records for almost every occasion an individual comes into contact with the state bureaucracy . Accident reports and tra\ufb03c citation records are made publicly available by many states . Voting records can reveal one \u2019 s political party a\ufb03liation , date of birth , place of birth , email address , home address , telephone number,5"}]}

An individual \u2019 s profession and place of employment often generate a number of records . Many professions require licenses , such as doc- tors , lawyers , engineers , insurance agents , nurses , police , account- ants , and teachers . If an individual is injured at work , worker \u2019 s compensation records may disclose the date of birth , type of injury , and SSN.7 If a person is a public employee , many personal details are released to the public by way of personnel records , including home address , phone number , SSN , salary , sick leave , and sometimes even email messages.8 In Massachusetts , government o\ufb03cials are required by law to maintain \u201c street lists \u201d containing the names , addresses , dates of birth , veteran statuses , nationalities , and occupations of all residents . These lists , which organize residents by the streets they live on , are made available to the police , to all political committees and candidates , and to businesses and other organizations.9 One \u2019 s home and property are also a matter of public record . Prop- erty tax assessment records contain a detailed description of the home , including number of bedrooms and bathrooms , amenities such as swimming pools , the size of the house , and the value . Other property ownership records unveil lifestyle information such as whether one owns a boat , and if so , its size and type.10 Often , any contact with law enforcement o\ufb03cials will yield a record .

Court records can be very revealing . In almost all states , court records are presumed to be public.12 Although current practice and existing physical constraints limit the extent to which personal infor- mation in court documents can be accessed , new technologies are on the verge of changing this reality . In civil cases , court \ufb01les may contain medical histories , mental health data , tax returns , and \ufb01nancial information.13 For example , in an ordinary civil lawsuit over an automobile accident , the plainti\ufb00 must submit medical information , including any pre-existing condi- tions that might be responsible for her symptoms . This data could even include psychological information . To establish damages , the plainti\ufb00 must also reveal details about her lifestyle , activities , and em- ployment .

In addition to plainti\ufb00s , civil defendants must also yield personal in- formation in many instances .

If a person serves as a juror , her name , address , spouse \u2019 s name , occupation , place of employment , and answers to voir dire questions may become part of the court record.14 Some courts have held that the public may have access to questionnaires given to jurors as part of voir dire.15 Voir dire questions can involve sensitive matters such as whether a juror was the victim of a crime , the juror \u2019 s political and religious beliefs , any medical and psychologi- cal conditions that might a\ufb00ect the juror \u2019 s performance , and other private details.16 Beyond ordinary civil lawsuits , special civil proceedings , such as appeals from the denial of Social Security bene\ufb01ts , release much in- formation into court records , including a person \u2019 s disability , work per- formance , SSN , birth date , address , phone number , and medical records.17 In federal bankruptcy courts , any \u201c paper \ufb01led . . . and the dockets of a bankruptcy court are public records and open to exami- nation by an entity at reasonable times without charge. \u201d 18 Information \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m o f p u b l i c r e c o r d s involved in bankruptcy proceedings includes one \u2019 s SSN , account numbers , employment data , sources of income , expenses , debts owed , and other \ufb01nancial information.19 Additionally , in certain cir- cumstances , employees of a company that declares bankruptcy can have their personal information divulged in public bankruptcy records.20 In some states , family court proceedings are public . For example , a divorce proceeding can unmask the intimacies of marital relation- ships . As the New Hampshire Supreme Court held , \u201c [ a ] private citizen seeking a divorce in this State must unavoidably do so in a public fo- rum , and consequently many private family and marital matters be- come public. \u201d 21 Parties in criminal cases have even less privacy .

Pre-sentence re- ports prepared by probation o\ufb03cers about convicted defendants fac- ing sentence are used by judges in arriving at the appropriate sentence .

All \uf735\uf730 states have enacted some version of Megan \u2019 s Law.25 Sex o\ufb00ender records often contain SSNs , photographs , addresses , prior convictions , and places of employment.26 A number of states have placed their sex o\ufb00ender records on the Internet . Some localities are even publicizing records about individuals ar- rested , but not yet convicted , of certain crimes . In \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf737 Kansas City initiated \u201c John TV , \u201d broadcasting on a government-owned television station the names , photographs , addresses , and ages of people who t h e p r o b l e m o f p u b l i c r e c o r d s \u25b2 had merely been arrested ( not convicted ) for soliciting prostitutes , and other cities have initiated similar programs.27 Additionally , a growing number of states are furnishing online databases of all of their current inmates and parolees.28 The Impact of Technology For a long time , public records have been accessible only in the vari- ous localities in which they were kept . A person or entity desiring to \ufb01nd out about the value of an individual \u2019 s home would have to travel to the town or county where the property was located and search through the records at the local courthouse . Depending upon local practice , the seeker of a record might be able to obtain a copy through the mail . Court records , such as bankruptcy records , would typically be obtained by visiting a courthouse or engaging in a lengthy corre- spondence with the clerk \u2019 s o\ufb03ce.29 The seeker of a record could not obtain records en masse ; records could only be obtained for speci\ufb01c individuals . This reality is rapidly changing . As records are increasingly com- puterized , entire record systems rather than individual records can be easily searched , copied , and transferred . Private-sector organizations sweep up millions of records from record systems throughout the country and consolidate them into gigantic record systems . Many websites now compile public records from across the country.30 There are more than \uf731\uf736\uf735 companies o\ufb00ering public record information over the Internet.31 These companies have constructed gigantic databases of public records that were once dispersed throughout di\ufb00erent agen- cies , o\ufb03ces , and courthouses\u2014and with the click of a mouse , mil- lions of records can be scoured for details.32 The increasing digitization of documents and the use of electronic \ufb01ling"}]}

Currently , most courts post only court rulings and schedules on their websites . Only a handful of courts now post complaints and other legal documents.33 However , states are beginning to require documents to be \ufb01led electronically and to convert existing records into digital format . For example , in New Jersey , bankruptcy records ( including a debtor \u2019 s bankruptcy petition ) are scanned into electronic \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m o f p u b l i c r e c o r d s format and can be accessed through the Internet.34 Some companies are beginning to make digital images of records available over the In- ternet.35 The federal court system is currently developing a system that makes full case \ufb01les accessible via the Internet.36 Beyond greater accessibility , technology may also lead to the reten- tion of greater amounts of personal information in public records . Under current practice , due to storage space constraints , clerks \u2019 o\ufb03ces often do not maintain copies of exhibits and other documents related to trials . However , as court documents such as pleadings and exhibits are \ufb01led in digital format , they will become easier to store . Further , under current practice , transcripts are typically produced only when a case is appealed . New technology enables transcripts of court proceedings to be made instantaneously without having to be transcribed . The increased use of such technology could result in the existence of more transcripts of trials , which can potentially include personal information about many parties and witnesses . In sum , the increasing digitization of documents enables more documents to be retained by eliminating storage constraints , in- creases the ability to access and copy documents , and permits the transfer of documents en masse . Personal information in public records , once protected by the practical di\ufb03culties of gaining access to the records , is increasingly less obscure . The Regulation of Public Records As it currently stands , public records law is a complicated and diverse hodge-podge of various statutes , court practices , and common law rights that vary from state to state and leave much personal informa- tion unprotected . A broad overview of the law that governs public records reveals that it is disconnected , often outdated , and inade- quate to meet the challenges of the new technologies of the Informa- tion Age . The Common Law , Court Records , and Protective Orders . At common law , English courts rarely encountered cases involving an individual seek- ing to gain access to government records.37 Only in unusual circum- stances could individuals inspect government records , such as when t h e p r o b l e m o f p u b l i c r e c o r d s \u25b2 people needed them for"}]}

When documents were introduced into evidence , individuals were permitted access.39 Early U.S. courts followed the English practice.40 Only if a person had a \u201c special interest \u201d in examining records would access be granted.41 Later on , the common law evolved to expand the \u201c interest \u201d required for inspection to include redressing public wrongs and mon- itoring government functions.42 The law then broadened even further to include all purposes that were not improper or harmful to others.43 One of the most commonly mentioned improper purposes was \u201c to satisfy idle curiosity or for the purpose of creating a public scandal. \u201d 44 In contrast to public records , the right to inspect court records was generally broader and was shaped by the supervisory authority of the courts.45 The courts had a long tradition of permitting open access to court records , and access was rarely limited based on the purposes for which the records were sought.46 In \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf738 , in Nixon v. Warner Com- munications , Inc. , the Supreme Court noted that \u201c [ i ] t is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general right to inspect and copy public records and documents , including judicial records and docu- ments. \u201d 47 The right is justi\ufb01ed by \u201c the citizen \u2019 s desire to keep a watch- ful eye on the workings of public agencies , and in a newspaper publisher \u2019 s intention to publish information concerning the opera- tion of government. \u201d The common law right of access isn \u2019 t absolute , especially for court records , because \u201c [ e ] very court has supervisory power over its own records and \ufb01les , \u201d and can deny access when records reveal embarrassing personal information or cause harm . The decision over whether to permit access \u201c is one best left to the sound discretion of the trial court. \u201d 48 In the federal court system , pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Proce- dure \uf732\uf736 ( c ) , judges have discretion \u201c for good cause shown \u201d to issue protective orders to shield information from disclosure where it might cause a party \u201c annoyance , embarrassment , oppression , or un- due burden or expense. \u201d 49 Protective orders allow documents to be used by parties to a case , but restrict public access . Most states have a rule similar to Rule \uf732\uf736 ( c ) .50 Since court records are presumed to be publicly accessible , a party seeking a protective order must overcome the presumption.51 Courts balance a party \u2019 s interest in privacy against \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m o f p u b l i c r e c o r d s the public interest in disclosure.52 If a court decides to deny access , it \u201c must set"}]}

A court will sometimes , under very limited circumstances , seal court proceedings such as tri- als.54 A court can allow a plainti\ufb00 to proceed anonymously with the use of a pseudonym.55 Courts can also permit anonymous juries when jurors might otherwise be placed in danger . These decisions , how- ever , are within the discretion of the trial court , and courts di\ufb00er greatly in the exercise of their discretion . For example , one court per- mitted a woman who had been raped at a train station and was suing Amtrak to keep her identity secret because of the potential embar- rassment she would su\ufb00er if the details of her rape became known in her community.56 In contrast , another court held that a victim of sex- ual assault could not sue her assailant for civil damages under a pseu- donym because \u201c [ f ] airness requires that she be prepared to stand behind her charges publicly \u201d and because she was \u201c seeking to vindi- cate primarily her own interests. \u201d 57 In sum , under modern American common law , there is a limited right to access public records so long as one \u2019 s purpose is not im- proper . For court records , the common law right to access follows the supervisory authority of the courts , and judges have signi\ufb01cant dis- cretion in granting or denying access.58 Freedom of Information Laws . State legislatures gradually replaced or supplemented the common law right of access with open records statutes , which generally mandated broad access.59 These statutes are called \u201c freedom of information , \u201d \u201c open access , \u201d \u201c right to know , \u201d or \u201c sunshine \u201d laws . States were initially slow in enacting statutory public access rights ; by \uf731\uf739\uf734\uf730 , only \uf731\uf732 states had open records statutes.60 In \uf731\uf739\uf736\uf736 , Congress passed the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) , pro- viding substantial public access to records of the federal government . When he signed the FOIA into law , President Lyndon Johnson de- clared that \u201c democracy works best when the people have all the infor- mation that the security of the Nation permits .

Most state FOIAs contain a presumption in favor of disclosure.67 Open access laws never mandate absolute disclosure . They con- tain exemptions , typically ( although not always ) including an exemp- tion to protect individual privacy . The federal FOIA contains nine enumerated exemptions to disclosure , two of which pertain to pri- vacy .

FOIA does not require that the government with- hold information ; it is up to the government agency to assert and to litigate the individual \u2019 s privacy interest.69 State FOIA privacy exemptions come in myriad shapes and sizes . Many state FOIAs contain privacy exemptions similar to those found in the federal FOIA , applying when disclosure would constitute a \u201c clearly unwarranted \u201d invasion of privacy.70 However , not all state FOIAs have privacy exemptions . Pennsylvania \u2019 s Right to Know Act does not contain a privacy exemption ; it prohibits only access to records \u201c which would operate to the prejudice or impairment of a person \u2019 s reputation or personal security. \u201d 71 As one court stated , \u201c the phrase \u2018 personal security \u2019 does not mean \u2018 personal privacy. \u2019 \u201d 72 Ohio \u2019 s Public Records Act does not contain any privacy exemption.73 \u25b2 t h e p r o b l e m o f p u b l i c r e c o r d s In applying FOIA privacy exemptions , many states follow the fed- eral FOIA approach and balance interests of privacy against the inter- ests of public access.74 However , states have adopted widely di\ufb00ering approaches often stemming from vastly di\ufb00erent judicial concep- tions of privacy . Privacy Acts . The Privacy Act of \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf734 regulates the record systems of federal agencies .

The Privacy Act has signi\ufb01cant limitations . It is limited only to the public sector . It applies to federal , not state and local agencies . Further , the Act has been eroded by about a dozen excep- tions . For example , agencies can disclose information without the consent of individuals to the Census Bureau , to law enforcement enti- ties , to Congress , and to credit reporting agencies . When FOIA re- quires that information be released , the Privacy Act does not apply . Nor does the Privacy Act apply to court records.76 The broadest exception is that information may be disclosed for any \u201c routine use \u201d if disclosure is \u201c compatible \u201d with the purpose for which the agency collected the information.77 The \u201c routine use \u201d ex- ception has repeatedly been criticized as being a gigantic loophole.78 As privacy law expert Robert Gellman writes , \u201c [ t ] his vague formula has not created much of a substantive barrier to external disclosure of personal information. \u201d 79 Although the Privacy Act requires an individual \u2019 s permission be- fore his or her records can be disclosed , redress for violations of the Act is virtually impossible to obtain.80 The Privacy Act provides indi- viduals with a monetary remedy for disclosures of personal informa- tion only if the disclosure was made \u201c willfully and intentionally. \u201d 81 This restriction on recovery of damages fails to redress the most com- mon form of mistakes\u2014those due to carelessness . This leaves little incentive to bring suit against violators.82 For example , in Andrews v. Veterans Administration , the Veterans Administration released inade- quately redacted personnel records of nurses , resulting in what the t h e p r o b l e m o f p u b l i c r e c o r d s \u25b2 court called a \u201c substantial \u201d violation of nurses \u2019 privacy . However , the agency could not be sued under the Privacy Act because it acted neg- ligently , not willfully.83 Moreover , less than a third of the states have enacted a general privacy law akin to the Privacy Act.84 Paul Schwartz observes that most states lack \u201c omnibus data protection laws \u201d and have \u201c scattered laws [ that ] provide only limited protections for per- sonal information in the public sector. \u201d 85 Access and Use Restrictions . Confronted with increased information trade , some states have attempted to restrict access to personal infor- mation in public records as well as certain uses of personal informa- tion obtained from public records . In the last decade , a number of states have enacted access restrictions for some of their public records , often excluding access for commercial uses , such as solicit- ing business or marketing services or products .

In \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf734 , Congress passed the Driver \u2019 s Privacy Protection Act ( DPPA ) to curtail states \u2019 selling their motor vehicle records to marketers.95 In Reno v. Condon , the Supreme Court concluded that DPPA was a proper exercise of Congress \u2019 s authority to regulate interstate com- merce . Further , the Court concluded that DPPA \u201c regulates the States as the owners of databases \u201d and does not require them to enact regu- lation or to assist in enforcing federal statutes concerning private in- dividuals.96 Although DPPA is an important \ufb01rst step in bringing state public records systems under control , DPPA applies only to motor ve- hicle records and does not forbid the dissemination of all the other public records states maintain .

By promoting awareness of the workings of gov- ernment , transparency serves a \u201c watchdog \u201d function . Open access to government proceedings ensures that they are conducted fairly . Open access exposes the government to public scrutiny and enables a check on abuse and corruption . \u201c Sunlight is said to be the best of dis- infectants , \u201d declared Justice Brandeis , \u201c electric light the most e\ufb03cient policeman. \u201d 2 Making arrest records public , for example , protects against secret arrests and government abuses.3 Open access to public court records \u201c allows the citizenry to monitor the functioning of our courts , thereby insuring quality , honesty , and respect for our legal sys- tem. \u201d 4 As James Madison observed : \u201c A popular Government , without popular information , or the means of acquiring it , is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy ; or , perhaps both . Knowledge will forever govern ignorance : And a people who mean to be their own Governors , must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives. \u201d 5 According to Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes : It is desirable that the trial of [ civil ] causes should take place un- der the public eye not because the controversies of one citizen with another are of public concern , but because it is of the high- est moment that those who administer justice should always act under the sense of public responsibility , and that every citizen should be able to satisfy himself with his own eyes as to the mode in which a public duty is performed.6 Access to court records permits people to examine the information considered by courts making decisions a\ufb00ecting the public at large .

Information about a politician \u2019 s criminal history might be informative to many voters . In- formation about a politician \u2019 s property may provide insight into the politician \u2019 s wealth , a factor that might shape the politician \u2019 s values and public decisions . Some voters may \ufb01nd a politician \u2019 s divorce records and marital history illustrative of the person \u2019 s character . Other possibly informative information about a politician could in- clude that she was sued many times or sued others many times ; that she once declared bankruptcy ; that she never voted in any elections ; that she was formerly registered in another political party ; that she owns property in other states ; and so on . Open access to public records enables voters to \ufb01nd out such information so they may make more informed choices at the polls . Third , transparency facilitates certain social transactions . Access to public records is an essential function for the sale and transfer of property , as it enables people to trace ownership and title in land . Public record information is useful in locating witnesses for judicial proceedings as well as locating heirs to estates . Further , access to public records can allow individuals and entities to track down indi- viduals they want to sue and to obtain the necessary information to serve them with process .

Public records can help verify individual identity , investigate fraud , and lo- cate lost friends and classmates . Public records enable law enforce- ment o\ufb03cials to locate criminals and investigate crimes , and can assist in tracking down deadbeat parents . Public records can permit people to investigate babysitters or child care professionals .

Before turning to this question , I must \ufb01rst address how the privacy problem to which pub- lic records contribute should be understood . We must rethink certain longstanding notions about privacy before we can reach an appropri- ate balance between transparency and privacy . Conceptualizing Privacy and Public Records Access : The Public Is Private . The secrecy paradigm , as discussed in chapter \uf733 , is deeply entrenched in information privacy law . In addi- tion to focusing on whether information is completely secret or not , the paradigm categorizes information as either public or private . When information is private , it is hidden , and as long as it is kept se- cret , it remains private . When it is public , it is in the public domain available for any use . Information is seen in this black-and-white manner ; either it is wholly private or wholly public . This paradigm is outmoded in the Information Age . Unless we live as hermits , there is no way to exist in modern society without leaving information traces wherever we go . Therefore , we must abandon the secrecy paradigm . Privacy involves an expectation of a certain degree of accessibility of information . Under this alternative view , privacy entails control over and limitations on certain uses of information , even if the information is not concealed . Privacy can be violated by altering levels of accessibility , by taking obscure facts and making them widely accessible . Our expectation of limits on the degree of ac- cessibility emerges from the fact that information in public records has remained relatively inaccessible until recently . Our personal in- formation in public records remained private because it was a needle in a haystack , and usually nobody would take the time to try to \ufb01nd it . This privacy is rapidly disappearing as access to information is in- creasing . In limited contexts , some courts are beginning to abandon the se- crecy paradigm , although most courts still cling to it . In United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , the Supreme Court held that the release of FBI \u201c rap sheets \u201d was an in- vasion of privacy within the privacy exemption of FOIA . The FBI rap \u25b2 a c c e s s a n d a g g r e g a t i o n sheets contained the date of birth , physical description , and a history of arrests , charges , and convictions on over \uf732\uf734 million people . The re- porters argued that the rap sheet wasn \u2019 t private because it was merely a collection of data that had previously been publicly disclosed . The Court didn \u2019 t agree , noting that \u201c there is a vast di\ufb00erence between the"}]}

In Melvin v. Reid , a former prostitute who was once criminally prosecuted for murder had left the prostitution business long ago and got married . When the movie The Red Kimono , depicted her life story and used her maiden name , she sued under the tort of public disclosure . The court held that although she could not claim that the facts about her life were private because they were in the public record , there was no need for the movie to use her real name.9 Likewise , in Briscoe v. Reader \u2019 s Digest Ass \u2019 n , an article in Reader \u2019 s Di- gest magazine about hijacking disclosed that the plainti\ufb00 had hi- jacked a truck \uf731\uf731 years earlier . Briscoe had rehabilitated himself , and his new friends , family , and young daughter weren \u2019 t aware of his crime . The court held that although the facts of the crime could be disclosed , Briscoe could sue for the use of his name , which had no rel- evance to the article.10 Generally , however , most courts still adhere to the secrecy para- digm and do not recognize a privacy interest when information is ex- posed to the public . As a result , most courts have rejected the Reid and Briscoe approach.11 In Forsher v. Bugliosi,12 the court considered Briscoe \u201c an exception to the more general rule that \u2018 once a man has become a public \ufb01gure , or news , he remains a matter of legitimate re- call to the public mind to the end of his days. \u2019 \u201d 13 Likewise , the Re- statement for the tort of public disclosure explains : \u201c There is no liability when the defendant merely gives further publicity to infor- mation about the plainti\ufb00 that is already public . Thus there is no lia- bility for giving publicity to facts about the plainti\ufb00 \u2019 s life which are matters of public record. \u201d 14 Similarly , for the tort of intrusion upon a c c e s s a n d a g g r e g a t i o n \u25b2 seclusion , the Restatement provides that \u201c there is no liability for the examination of a public record concerning the plainti\ufb00. \u201d 15 Further , Briscoe seems foreclosed by the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision in Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn , which held that when information is dis- closed in documents open to the public , the press can not be pun- ished for publishing it.16 In a number of cases , courts applying"}]}

Courts have refused to \ufb01nd a constitutional right to information pri- vacy for data exposed to the public . In Scheetz v.

Although her complaint to the police did not result in charges , \u201c [ t ] he police could have brought charges without her concurrence , at which point all the information would have wound up on the public record , where it would have been non-con\ufb01dential. \u201d 17 In Cline v.

City of Petersburg , public em- ployees were questioned about the criminal histories of their family members , their complete marital history , including marriages , di- vorces , and children , and any outstanding debts or judgments against them . According to the court , the information wasn \u2019 t private because it was already available in public records.19 Courts have also adhered to the secrecy paradigm in challenges to Megan \u2019 s Laws , which mandate the public disclosure of information about prior sex o\ufb00enders . In Russell v. Gregoire , convicted sex o\ufb00en- ders challenged the disclosure of their picture , name , age , date of birth , crimes , and neighborhoods in which they lived . The court held that the information wasn \u2019 t private because it was \u201c already fully avail- able to the public. \u201d 20 Likewise , in Paul P. v. Verniero , the court held there was no privacy interest in the names and physical descriptions of previously convicted sex o\ufb00enders.21 In sum , although divided , most courts adhere to the secrecy para- digm .

The harm stems from the aggregation e\ufb00ect discussed in chapter \uf733 . Viewed in isolation , each piece of our day-to-day information is not all that telling ; viewed in combination , it begins to paint a portrait about our personalities . Moreover , these digital biographies greatly increase our vulnerability to a variety of dangers . As public record in- formation becomes more readily available , criminals can use it to gain access to a person \u2019 s \ufb01nancial accounts . For example , one indus- trious criminal gained access to the \ufb01nancial accounts of a number of individuals on Forbes magazine \u2019 s list of the \uf734\uf730\uf730 richest people in America such as Oprah Winfrey and George Lucas.25 Identity thieves frequently obtain personal information necessary for their criminal activity through information brokers , who sell reports about individ- uals based on public record data combined with other information.26 As discussed in chapter \uf736 , the SSN is the most useful tool of the iden- tity thief , and SSNs are often available in various public records . a c c e s s a n d a g g r e g a t i o n s Public record information also can expose people to violence . In \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf739 , a fan obsessed with actress Rebecca Shae\ufb00er located her home address with the help of a private investigator who obtained it from California motor vehicles records . The fan murdered her outside her home . This killing spurred Congress to pass the Driver \u2019 s Privacy Pro- tection Act ( DPPA ) , which restricts the states \u2019 ability to release motor vehicle records.27 In another example , an Internet site known as the \u201c Nuremberg Files \u201d posted information about doctors working in abortion clinics , including names , photos , SSNs , home addresses , de- scriptions of their cars , and information about their families.28 Doc- tors who were killed had a black line drawn through their names .

At a more abstract level , the existence of digital dossiers alters the nature of the society we live in . In \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf731 , in his highly in\ufb02uential book , The Assault on Privacy , law professor Arthur Miller warned of the \u201c possibility of constructing a sophisticated data center capable of generating a comprehensive womb-to-tomb dossier on every indi- vidual and transmitting it to a wide range of data users over a national network. \u201d 30 On a number of occasions , the federal government has \ufb02irted with the idea of creating a national database of personal infor- mation . The Johnson administration contemplated creating a Na- tional Data Center that would combine information collected by various federal agencies into one large computer database , but the plan was scrapped after a public outcry arose.31 Again , in the early \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730s , an o\ufb03cial in the General Services Administration proposed that all of the federal government \u2019 s computer systems be connected in a network called FEDNET . Responding to a public outcry , Vice President Gerald Ford stopped the plan.32 Although these proposals have been halted due to public outcries , we have been inching toward a system of de facto national identi\ufb01ca- tion for some time and are precariously close to having one.33 The \u25b2 a c c e s s a n d a g g r e g a t i o n Immigration Reform and Control Act of \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf736 requires new employees to supply identi\ufb01cation and proof of U.S. citizenship before obtaining a new job.34 In a recent e\ufb00ort to track down parents who fail to pay child support , the federal government has created a vast database consisting of information about all people who obtain a new job any- where in the nation . The database contains their SSNs , addresses , and wages.35 The ready availability of one \u2019 s SSN and the ability to combine it with a host of other information about individuals will make increasingly more possible a reality where typing an individ- ual \u2019 s name into a searchable database will pull up a \u201c womb-to-tomb \u201d dossier . Such a reality can pose signi\ufb01cant dangers . \u201c Identity systems and documents , \u201d observes political scientist Richard Sobel , \u201c have a long history of uses and abuses for social control and discrimination. \u201d 36 Slaves were required to carry identifying papers to travel ; identi\ufb01ca- tion cards were used by the Nazis in locating Jews ; and the slaughter of Tutsis in Rwanda was aided by a"}]}

The problems and dangers just illustrated are not merely the prod- uct of the actions of the government . Rather , these troubles are caused by the way that both public- and private-sector entities are using personal information . The issue concerns more than isolated threats and harms , but is fundamentally about the structure of our society .

As I discussed earlier in this a c c e s s a n d a g g r e g a t i o n \u25b2 book , although people may be aware that dossiers are being assem- bled about them , they have no idea what information the dossiers contain or how the dossiers are being used . This reality leads to un- ease , vulnerability , and powerlessness\u2014a deepening sense that one is at the mercy of others , or , perhaps even more alarming , at the mercy of a bureaucratic process that is arbitrary , irresponsible , opaque , and indi\ufb00erent to people \u2019 s dignity and welfare . The problem with information collection and use today is not merely that individuals are no longer able to exercise control over their information ; it is that their information is subjected to a bureau- cratic process that is itself out of control . Without this process being subject to regulation and control and without individuals having rights to exercise some dominion over their information , individuals will be routinely subjected to the ills of bureaucracy . Public records contribute to this privacy problem because they are often a principal source of information for businesses in the con- struction of their databases . Marketers stock their databases with public record information , and the uses to which these databases are put are manifold and potentially limitless . The personal information in public records is often supplied involuntarily and typically for a purpose linked to the reason why particular records are kept . The"}]}

The problem is not necessarily the dis- closure of secrets or the injury of reputations , but is one created by increased access and aggregation of data . Privacy is an issue that con- cerns what type of society we want to construct for the future . Do we want to live in a Kafkaesque world where dossiers about individuals circulate in an elaborate underworld of public- and private-sector bureaucracies without the individual having notice , knowledge , or the ability to monitor or control the ways the information is used ? \u25b2 a c c e s s a n d a g g r e g a t i o n Transparency and Privacy : Reconciling the Tension How can the tension between transparency and privacy be recon- ciled ? Must access to public records be sacri\ufb01ced at the altar of pri- vacy ? Or must privacy evaporate in order for government to be disinfected by sunlight ? Both transparency and privacy can be balanced through limita- tions on the access and use of personal information in public records . Of course , we must rethink what information belongs in public records . But we must also regulate the uses of our digital dossiers . The government is not doing enough to protect against the uses of the in- formation that it routinely pumps into the public domain . If we aban- don the notion that privacy is an exclusive status , and recognize that information in public records can still remain private even if there is limited access to it , then we can \ufb01nd a workable compromise for the tension between transparency and privacy . We can make information accessible for certain purposes only . When government discloses in- formation , it can limit how it discloses that information by preventing it from being amassed by companies for commercial purposes , from being sold to others , or from being combined with other information and sold back to the government . Much of the personal information in public records is not neces- sary to shed light on the way government carries out its functions . Rather , this information reveals more about the people who are the subjects of the government \u2019 s regulatory machinery . Although the fed- eral FOIA has served to shed light on government activities and has supplied critical information for hundreds of books and articles , it has also been used as a tool for commercial interests . The vast major- ity of FOIA requests are made by businesses for commercial pur- poses.40 According to Judge Patricia Wald , FOIA turns agencies into \u201c information"}]}

State FOIAs generally do not permit any discrimination among re- questers . In a number of cases , o\ufb03cials wanting to restrict access to people requesting records for commercial use had no statutory au- thority to do so . In Dunhill v. Director , District of Columbia Depart- ment of Transportation , a marketer of personal information about individuals sought a listing on computer tape of the names , ad- dresses , birth dates , gender , and expiration date of drivers \u2019 permits of all people holding valid District of Columbia drivers \u2019 permits . The court held that the government had to release the information be- cause the statute didn \u2019 t authorize the government to look to the mo- tives of the request.43 In In re Crawford , a preparer of bankruptcy petitions for debtors challenged the requirement that he divulge his SSN on the petition , which would then be made public . The court rec- ognized that although disclosure of his SSN exposed him to potential fraud and identity theft , the interest in public access \u201c is of special im- portance in the bankruptcy arena , as unrestricted access to judicial records fosters con\ufb01dence among creditors regarding the fairness of the bankruptcy system. \u201d 44 Thus , the court formalistically invoked the principle of transparency , relying on the vague argument that total transparency fosters \u201c con\ufb01dence. \u201d The danger with any principle is that it can drift to di\ufb00erent uses over time . Jack Balkin identi\ufb01es this problem as \u201c ideological drift. \u201d \u201c Ideological drift in law means that legal ideas and symbols will change their political valence as they are used over and over again in new contexts. \u201d 45 Laws fostering transparency are justi\ufb01ed as shedding light into the dark labyrinths of government bureaucracy to expose its inner workings to public scrutiny , and preventing the harrowing situ- ation in Kafka \u2019 s The Trial\u2014a bureaucracy that worked in clandestine and mysterious ways , completely unaccountable and unchecked . These are certainly laudable goals , for they are essential to democ- racy and to the people \u2019 s ability to keep government under control .

A window to look in on the government is transforming into a window for the government and allied corporations to peer in on individuals . The data collected about individuals is then subject to a bureaucratic process that is often careless , uncontrolled , and clan- destine . Because private-sector bureaucracies lack the transparency of government bureaucracies , there is a greater potential for personal information to be abused . Paradoxically , a right of access designed to empower individuals and protect them from the ills of bureaucracy can lead to exactly the opposite result . There are certainly instances where information about individuals can illuminate government functioning . Examination of accident re- ports may reveal widespread problems with particular vehicles . Scrutiny of police records may indicate problems in police investiga- tion and enforcement . Information about the salaries of public o\ufb03- cials and employees allows the public to assess whether they are being over- or under-compensated . Disciplinary information about public employees allows taxpayers to scrutinize the performance of those who are earning their tax dollars . However , many of these pur- poses can be achieved through evaluating aggregate statistical data or by examining records with redacted personal identifying information . The solution is not to eliminate all access to public records , but to redact personal information where possible and to regulate speci\ufb01c uses of information . Real property information must be made avail- able for certain purposes , but it should not be available for all pur- poses . A person may need to obtain the address of a celebrity to serve process in a lawsuit ; however , disclosing the address to fans or on the Internet is di\ufb00erent . Use restriction laws , such as those discussed in chapter \uf737 , are a step in the right direction . These laws attempt to navigate the tension between transparency and privacy by permitting the use of public record information for certain purposes but not all purposes . One of the longstanding Fair Information Practices is purpose speci\ufb01ca- tion\u2014that personal information obtained for one purpose can not be used for another purpose without an individual \u2019 s consent.46 Often the purposes for the government collection of personal information vary widely from the purposes for which the data is used after it is dis- closed in public records . Governments collecting personal informa- a c c e s s a n d a g g r e g a t i o n \u25b2 tion should limit such uncontrolled drift in use .

Use restriction laws must go beyond basic restrictions on access for commercial solicitation . The use of public records by information brokers or other entities that aggregate personal information and sell it to others is deeply problematic for the reasons discussed earlier in this chapter . Although information brokers have brought a new level of accessibility to public records , they have also contributed greatly to the creation of digital dossiers . This type of aggregated public record information is often not used for the purposes of checking govern- mental abuse or monitoring governmental activities . Rather , it is used to investigate individuals . This investigation is at the behest of other individuals , private detectives , employers , and law enforcement o\ufb03- cials . Information brokers such as ChoicePoint collect public record information and supplement it with a host of other personal informa- tion , creating a convenient investigation tool for government entities . The use of information brokers by the government to investigate citi- zens runs directly counter to the spirit of freedom of information laws , which were designed to empower individuals to monitor their government , not vice versa . Certain information should be restricted from public records com- pletely . The proposal by the Administrative O\ufb03ce of the U.S. Court System to separate both paper and electronic documents into a pub- lic and private \ufb01le for civil cases and to restrict access to certain docu- ments in criminal proceedings such as pre-sentence reports is a step in the right direction.47 One example of information that should be ex- cluded from public records is a person \u2019 s SSN.48 SSNs serve as a gate- way to highly sensitive information such as \ufb01nancial accounts , school records , and a host of other data . As a routine practice , SSNs should be redacted from every document before being disclosed publicly . Jurors , parties to litigation , and witnesses should all be informed of the extent to which their personal information could become a public \u25b2 a c c e s s a n d a g g r e g a t i o n record and must be given an opportunity to voice their privacy con- cerns and have information redacted . Of course , provisions in the law can be made for people who want to consent to the disclosure of their personal information . If the re- quester desires personal information about a speci\ufb01c individual in a speci\ufb01c case , the agency or court can contact the individual , inform her of the purpose of the request , and ask if she consents to disclo- sure .

People should be permit- ted to sue for negligent infringements of the Act\u2014not just willful ones . Rarely do government agencies willfully disclose personal infor- mation in violation of the Privacy Act ; most disclosures occur because of carelessness and inadvertence . By expanding the Act in this way , agencies will have a strong incentive to treat their record systems with more care and to provide greater security for the personal informa- tion they maintain .

Moreover , the \u201c routine use \u201d exception must be signi\ufb01cantly tight- ened . Finally , more laws like the Driver \u2019 s Privacy Protection Act are nec- essary to ensure that states maintain adequate privacy protection in their public records law .

Understood broadly , the First Amendment pro- tects openness in information \ufb02ow . First , the Court has held that the First Amendment provides certain rights of access to at least some government proceedings . Restrictions on the information available in public records might infringe upon this right . Second , freedom of speech prevents the government from restricting the disclosure and dissemination of information . A close analysis of the Court \u2019 s deci- sions , however , reveals that access and use restrictions are constitu- tional . The Right of Access . The Supreme Court has held that the First Amend- ment mandates that certain government proceedings be open to the public . In Richmond Newspapers , Inc. v. Virginia , a plurality of the Court concluded that the public had a First Amendment right of ac- cess to criminal trials.49 Two years later , in Globe Newspaper Co. v.

According to the Court , a \u201c major purpose \u201d of the First Amendment is \u201c to protect the free dis- cussion of governmental a\ufb00airs. \u201d The Court articulated a two- pronged test to determine whether the right to access applies , \ufb01rst looking to whether the proceeding \u201c historically has been open to the press and general public \u201d and then examining whether access \u201c plays a particularly signi\ufb01cant role in the functioning of the judicial process and the government as a whole. \u201d 50 Shortly after Globe , the Court ex- tended the right to access beyond the immediate criminal trial to jury selection and to pretrial proceedings.51 Lower courts have proclaimed that the right of access applies to hearings for pretrial suppression , due process , entrapment , and bail.52 Although the Court has never squarely addressed whether the right of access applies beyond the criminal arena , several lower courts have extended it to civil cases . For example , in Publicker Industries , Inc. v. Cohen , the court reasoned that \u201c the civil trial , like the criminal trial , plays a particularly signi\ufb01cant role in the functioning of the judicial \u25b2 a c c e s s a n d a g g r e g a t i o n process and the government as a whole. \u201d 53 Several courts have even concluded that the right to access \u201c extends to at least some categories of court documents and records , \u201d but not all courts agree.54 Although courts have rarely applied the right of access beyond court records , since the rationale for the right is to provide knowledge about the workings of the government , the right might logically extend to other public records . Even under such an expansive view , however , the right of access shouldn \u2019 t prohibit many access and use restrictions . When public records illuminate government functioning , access to them is generally consistent with the rationale for the right of access . How- ever , the grand purposes behind the right are not present in the con- text of much information gathering from public records today . Public records are becoming a tool for powerful companies to use in further- ance of commercial gain . These uses do not shed light on the govern- ment . In fact , the Constitution does not simply require open informa- tion \ufb02ow ; it also establishes certain responsibilities for the way that the government uses the information it collects . The Court has held that there are circumstances where the government can not force in- dividuals to disclose personal information absent a compelling gov- ernment interest . In NAACP v. Alabama , the Court struck down a statute requiring the NAACP to disclose a list of its members because this could expose them to potential economic reprisal and physical violence , thus chilling their freedom of association.55 Similarly ,"}]}

Davis , the Fourth Circuit held that Virginia \u2019 s voter regis- tration system was unconstitutional because it forced people to pub- licly disclose their SSNs in order to vote , thus deterring people from voting by exposing them to potential harms such as identity theft and fraud.56 These cases establish that government disclosure of personal information it has collected can be unconstitutional when it inter- feres with the exercise of fundamental rights . Further , under the constitutional right to privacy , the Court has held that government has a duty to protect privacy when it collects personal data . In Whalen v. Roe , which I discussed in chapter \uf734 , the Court held that the right to privacy encompassed the protection of personal information : a c c e s s a n d a g g r e g a t i o n \u25b2 We are not unaware of the threat to privacy implicit in the accu- mulation of vast amounts of personal information in computer- ized data banks or other massive government \ufb01les . . . . The right to collect and use such data for public purposes is typically ac- companied by a concomitant statutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures . . . . [ I ] n some circumstances that duty arguably has its roots in the Constitution.57 Whalen recognized that when the government collects personal in- formation , it has a responsibility to keep it secure and con\ufb01dential . Since its creation in Whalen , the constitutional right to informa- tion privacy has begun to evolve in the courts , but it is still in the early stages of growth.58 The full extent of the government \u2019 s responsibilities in handling personal data awaits further development . Based on the cases decided thus far , the Constitution requires public access when information will shed light on the functioning of the government , and it requires con\ufb01dentiality when information pertains to the personal lives of individuals . Freedom of Speech . The First Amendment more directly fosters infor- mation \ufb02ow about government activities by forbidding restrictions on freedom of speech . Understanding how use and access restrictions on public record information interact with the First Amendment re- quires a di\ufb03cult navigation through a number of cases . In one series of cases , the Court has struck down statutes prohibiting the disclo- sure of information gleaned from public records . In Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn , the Court held that a state could not impose civil liabil- ity based upon publication of a rape victim \u2019 s name obtained from a court record : \u201c Once true information is disclosed in public court doc- uments open to public inspection , the press can not be sanctioned for publishing it. \u201d Punishing the press for publishing public record infor- mation would \u201c invite timidity and self-censorship and very likely lead to the suppression of many items that"}]}

B.J.F . in which a newspaper published the name of a rape victim , which it obtained from a publicly released police report . The report was in a room with signs stating that rape victims \u2019 names weren \u2019 t part of the public record and weren \u2019 t to be published . The reporter even admitted that she knew she wasn \u2019 t allowed to report on the information . When the story ran , many of the victim \u2019 s friends learned about her rape , and a man made threatening calls to her home . As a result , she had to change her phone number and residence , seek police protection , and obtain mental health counseling . Based upon a Florida law prohibit- ing the disclosure of rape victims \u2019 names , a jury found the paper li- able . The Supreme Court , however , held that the verdict ran afoul of the newspaper \u2019 s First Amendment rights.61 Taken together , these cases support the premise that once the government makes informa- tion public , the government can not subsequently sanction its further disclosure . However , in Los Angeles Police Department v. United Reporting Publishing Co. , the Court upheld a law restricting access for public ar- restee information . Requesters of the information had to declare un- der penalty of perjury that the address information would not be used \u201c directly or indirectly to sell a product or service. \u201d Rejecting a chal- lenge that the law infringed upon commercial speech , the Court rea- soned that the statute was not \u201c prohibiting a speaker from conveying information that the speaker already possesses \u201d but was merely \u201c a governmental denial of access to information in its possession. \u201d As long as the government doesn \u2019 t have a duty to provide access to infor- mation , it can selectively determine who can obtain it.62 The Court \u2019 s jurisprudence thus creates a distinction between pre- access conditions on obtaining information and post-access restric- tions on the use or disclosure of the information . If the government is not obligated to provide access to certain information by the First Amendment , it can amend its public access laws to establish pre-ac- cess conditions , restricting access for certain kinds"}]}

Govern- ments can make a public record available on the condition that a c c e s s a n d a g g r e g a t i o n \u25b2 certain information is not disclosed or used in a certain manner . However , once the information is made available , governments can- not establish post-access restrictions on its disclosure or use . The Court \u2019 s distinction between pre-access and post-access re- strictions seems rather tenuous . States can easily redraft their statutes to get around Florida Star . For example , Florida could rewrite its law to make rape victims \u2019 names available on the condition that the press promise the names not be disclosed . Conditional access and use re- strictions thus appear to be an end-run around Florida Star . Can the Court \u2019 s distinction between pre- and post-access restrictions be de- fended ? I believe it can . First , in Florida Star , the Court was concerned about the government \u2019 s failure \u201c to police itself in disseminating infor- mation. \u201d The mistake was made by the police department in failing to redact the name , and thus it was unfair \u201c to sanction persons other than the source of its release. \u201d 63 In contrast , with pre-access restric- tions , the government is taking the appropriate care to protect the in- formation itself . Second , in both Cox and Florida Star , the Court was concerned about the chilling e\ufb00ects to speech from the uncertainty over whether certain public record information could be disclosed . Pre-access re- strictions alleviate these concerns . Since the recipient of the informa- tion has to expressly agree to any restrictions on using the information beforehand , she will be on clear notice as to her obliga- tions and responsibilities in handling the data . Third , and most importantly , the distinction is a good practical compromise . Without a distinction between post- and pre-access conditions , the government would be forced into an all-or-nothing tradeo\ufb00 between transparency and privacy . The government could make records public , allowing all uses of the personal information , or the government could simply not make records available at all . By making access conditional on accepting certain responsibilities when using data , the public can have access to a wide range of records while privacy remains protected at the same time . Has the Court too quickly dispatched with the free speech implica- tions of conditional or limited access regulation ? For example , some argue that restrictions on commercial access are unconstitutional \u25b2 a c c e s s a n d a g g r e g a t i o n content-based restrictions on free speech because they single out speci\ufb01c messages and viewpoints\u2014namely , commercial ones .

Nor do they favor a particular speaker or speci\ufb01c ideas . Although particular categories of use ( i.e. , commercial ) are being singled out , avoiding viewpoint dis- crimination does not entail avoiding all attempts to categorize or limit uses of information . Indeed , the First Amendment constitu- tional regime depends upon categorizing speech . The Supreme Court protects certain categories of speech much less stringently than other forms of speech . Obscene speech , words that incite violence , and defamatory speech about private \ufb01gures all receive minimal protec- tion.65 Commercial speech is also singled out , safeguarded with only an intermediate level of scrutiny.66 Although there is no bright line that distinguishes when certain categories map onto particular view- points to such a degree as to constitute discrimination based on view- point , the category of commercial speech is broad enough to encompass a multitude of viewpoints and is a category that forms part of the architecture of the current constitutional regime . Therefore , governments should be able to restrict access for cer- tain purposes or condition access on an enforceable promise not to engage in certain uses of information . Of course , it would be im- proper for the government to single out particular viewpoints . Thus , for example , governments should not restrict access to public records to those who wish to use the information to advocate for certain causes rather than others . Nor could the government restrict access based on the particular beliefs or ideas of the person or entities seek- ing access to the information . In short , the government can \u2019 t single out certain uses because it dislikes the ideas or views of a particular speaker . A limitation on commercial use is broad enough to encom- pass a diverse enough range of viewpoints , and the government is merely limiting uses of information rather than the expression of par- ticular ideas . a c c e s s a n d a g g r e g a t i o n \u25b2 Public Records in the Information Age .

A number of employers also conduct drug test- g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g \u25b2 ing , and many require prospective employees to answer question- naires asking about drug use , \ufb01nances , psychological treatment , mar- ital history , and sexuality.6 Some even require prospective hires to take a psychological screening test.7 Landlords are another fertile source of personal information . Landlord records often contain \ufb01nancial , employment , and pet infor- mation , in addition to any tenant complaints . Many landlords also maintain log books at the front desk where visitors sign in . Some apartment buildings use biometric identi\ufb01cation devices , such as hand scanners , to control access to common areas such as gyms . Increasingly , companies and entities that we have never estab- lished any contact with nevertheless have dossiers about us . Credit reporting agencies maintain information relating to \ufb01nancial trans- actions , debts , creditors , and checking accounts . The government can also \ufb01nd out details about people \u2019 s race , income , opinions , political beliefs , health , lifestyle , and purchasing habits from the database companies that keep extensive personal information on millions of Americans .

First , it gives many indi- viduals a false sense of privacy . The secrecy and anonymity of the In- ternet is often a mirage . Rarely are people truly anonymous because ISPs keep records of a subscriber \u2019 s screen name and pseudonyms . ISP account information includes the subscriber \u2019 s name , address , phone numbers , passwords , information about web sur\ufb01ng sessions and durations , and \ufb01nancial information.8 By learning a person \u2019 s screen name , the government can identify who posted messages in news- groups or conversed in chatrooms . At the government \u2019 s request , an ISP can keep logs of the email ad- dresses with which a person corresponds . Further , if a person stores email that is sent and received with the ISP , the government can ob- tain the contents of those emails . Second , the Internet is unprecedented in the degree of information that can be gathered and stored . It is one of the most powerful gener- ators of records in human history . As discussed in chapter \uf732 , websites \u25b2 g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g often accumulate a great deal of information about their users , from transactional data to information collected through cookies . The gov- ernment can glean a substantial amount of information about visi- tors to a particular website . From Internet retailers , the government can learn about the books , videos , music , and electronics that one purchases . Some Internet retailers , such as Amazon.com , record all the purchases a person has made throughout many years . Based on this information , the government can discover a consumer \u2019 s interests , political views , religious beliefs , and lifestyle . The government may also obtain information from websites that operate personalized home pages . Home pages enable users to keep track of the stocks they own , favorite television channels , airfares for favorite destinations , and news of interest . Other websites , such as Microsoft Network \u2019 s calendar service , allow users to maintain their daily schedule and appointments . Further , as discussed in chapter \uf732 , there are database companies that amass extensive pro\ufb01les of peo- ple \u2019 s websur\ufb01ng habits . While life in the Information Age has brought us a dizzying amount of information , it has also placed a profound amount of information about our lives in the hands of numerous entities .

Government\u2013Private-Sector Information Flows In late \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732 , the news media reported that the Department of De- fense was planning a project known as Total Information Awareness ( TIA ) . The project was to be run by John Poindexter , who had been convicted in \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf730 for his activities during the Iran-contra scandal . TIA envisioned the creation of a gigantic government database of per- sonal information , including data culled from private-sector entities concerning \ufb01nances , education , travel , health , and so on . This infor- g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g \u25b2 mation would then be analyzed under various models to detect pat- terns and pro\ufb01les for terrorist activities.9 The website for the project contained the symbol of a pyramid with beams of light emanating from an eye at the top . Next to the pyramid was a globe , illuminated by the light . Underneath the image were the words scientia est poten- tia\u2014 \u201c knowledge is power. \u201d 10 When TIA broke as a major news story , civil liberties groups and many commentators and politicians voiced stinging criticism . In a New York Times editorial , William Sa\ufb01re wrote that Poindexter \u201c is de- termined to break down the wall between commercial snooping and secret government intrusion . . . . And he has been given a $ \uf732\uf730\uf730 mil- lion budget to create computer dossiers on \uf733\uf730\uf730 million Americans. \u201d 11 After these outcries , the pyramid and eye logo was quickly removed from the Department of Defense website . The Senate amended its spending bill in January \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733 to temporarily suspend funding for TIA until the details of the program were explained to Congress.12 In May \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733 , the Department of Defense issued its report to Congress , re- naming the program \u201c Terrorism Information Awareness \u201d and declar- ing ( without specifying how ) that it would protect privacy . Later on , in July , the Senate voted unanimously to stop funding for TIA . The pro- gram had been killed . But TIA is only one part of the story of government access to per- sonal information and its creation of dossiers on American citizens . In fact , for quite some time , the government has been increasingly contracting with businesses to acquire databases of personal infor- mation . Database \ufb01rms are willing to supply the information and the government is willing to pay for it . Currently , government agencies such as the FBI and IRS are purchasing databases of personal"}]}

In \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730 , the Justice Department signed an $ \uf738 million contract with ChoicePoint , and the IRS reached a deal with the company for between $ \uf738 and $ \uf731\uf732 million . ChoicePoint collects information from public records from around the country and then combines it with information from private detectives , the media , and credit reporting \ufb01rms . This data is indexed by people \u2019 s SSNs . The Center for Medicare \u25b2 g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g and Medicaid Services uses ChoicePoint \u2019 s data to help it identify fraudulent Medicare claims by checking health care provider ad- dresses against ChoicePoint \u2019 s list of \u201c high-risk and fraudulent busi- ness addresses. \u201d ChoicePoint \u2019 s information is not only used by government agencies but also by private-sector employers to screen new hires or investigate existing employees.14 ChoicePoint \u2019 s information is a mixture of fact and \ufb01ction . There are a number of errors in the records , such as when a ChoicePoint report falsely indicated that a woman was a convicted drug dealer and shoplifter , resulting in her being \ufb01red from her job.15 ChoicePoint also had a hand in the \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730 presidential election problems in Florida . ChoicePoint supplied Florida o\ufb03cials with a list of \uf738 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 \u201c ex-felons \u201d to eliminate from their voter lists.16 However , many of the \uf738 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 were not guilty of felonies , only misdemeanors , and were legally eligible to vote . Although the error was discovered prior to the election and o\ufb03- cials tried to place the individuals back on the voter rolls , the error may have led to some eligible voters being turned away at the polls . Additionally , many states have joined together to create a database system called Multi-State Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange , or MATRIX for short . Run by SeisInt , Inc. , a private-sector company in Florida , MATRIX contains personal information gathered from public records and from businesses . In its vast \ufb01elds of data , MATRIX in- cludes people \u2019 s criminal histories , photographs , property ownership , SSNs , addresses , bankruptcies , family members , and credit informa- tion . The federal government has provided $ \uf731\uf732 million to help support the program.17 A second form of information \ufb02ow from the private sector to the government emerges when the government requests private-sector records for particular investigations or compels their disclosure by subpoena or court order .

The September \uf731\uf731 , \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731 terrorist attacks changed the climate for private sector-to-government information \ufb02ows . Law enforcement o\ufb03cials have a greater desire to obtain information that could be helpful in identifying terrorists or their supporters , including infor- g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g \u25b2 mation about what people read , the people with whom they associ- ate , their religion , and their lifestyle . Following the September \uf731\uf731 at- tack , the FBI simply requested records from businesses without a subpoena , warrant , or court order.18 Recently , Attorney General John Ashcroft has revised longstanding guidelines for FBI surveillance practices . Under the previous version , the FBI could monitor public events and mine the Internet for information only when \u201c facts or cir- cumstances reasonably indicate that a federal crime has been , is be- ing , or will be committed. \u201d 19 Under the revised version , the FBI can engage in these types of information gathering without any require- ment that it be part of a legitimate investigation or related in any manner to criminal wrongdoing . The FBI can now collect \u201c publicly available information , whether obtained directly or through services or resources ( whether nonpro\ufb01t or commercial ) that compile or ana- lyze such information ; and information voluntarily provided by pri- vate entities. \u201d 20 Further , the FBI can \u201c carry out general topical research , including conducting online searches and accessing online sites and forums. \u201d 21 In conjunction with the government \u2019 s greater desire for personal information , the private sector has become more willing to supply it . Background check companies , for instance , experienced a large boost in business after September \uf731\uf731.22 Several large \ufb01nancial compa- nies developed agreements to provide information to federal law en- forcement agencies.23 Indeed , in times of crisis or when serious crimes are at issue , the incentives to disclose information to the gov- ernment are quite signi\ufb01cant . Shortly after September \uf731\uf731 , around \uf732\uf730\uf730 universities admitted to giving the FBI access to their records on for- eign students\u2014often without a subpoena or court order.24 In violation of its privacy policy , JetBlue Airlines shared the personal data of \uf731 mil- lion customers with Torch Concepts , an Alabama company contract- ing with the Defense Department to pro\ufb01le passengers for security risks . Torch combined the JetBlue data with SSNs , employment infor- mation , and other details obtained from Acxiom , Inc. , a database marketing company.25 In a similar incident , Northwest Airlines se- cretly turned over to NASA its customer data\u2014including addresses , phone numbers , and credit card information\u2014for use in a govern- ment data mining"}]}

These devices are very di\ufb00erent from warrants because they o\ufb00er little protection to the individual being investigated . Noti\ufb01- cation of the target of the investigation is often within the discretion of the third party . Further , it is up to the third party to challenge the subpoena . So , rather than spend the money and resources to chal- lenge the subpoena , companies can simply turn it over or permit the government to search their records . Since September \uf731\uf731 , AOL and Earthlink , two of the largest ISPs , have readily cooperated with the in- vestigation of the terrorist attacks.28 Often , ISPs have their own tech- nology to turn over communications and information about targets of investigations . If they lack the technology , law enforcement o\ufb03- cials can install devices such as \u201c Carnivore \u201d to locate the informa- tion.29 Carnivore , now renamed to the more innocuous \u201c DCS\uf731\uf730\uf730\uf730 , \u201d is a computer program installed by the FBI at an ISP.30 It can monitor all ISP email tra\ufb03c and search for certain keywords in the content or headers of the email messages . These developments are troubling because private-sector compa- nies often have weak policies governing when information may be disclosed to the government . The privacy policy for the MSN network , an a\ufb03liation of several Microsoft , Inc. websites such as Hotmail ( an email service ) , Health , Money , Newsletters , eShop , and Calendar , states : MSN Web sites will disclose your personal information , without notice , only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to : ( a ) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the site.31 Though somewhat unclear , this privacy policy appears to require a subpoena or court order for the government to obtain personal data .

EBay , a popular online auction website , has a policy stating that [ it ] cooperates with law enforcement inquiries , as well as other third parties to enforce laws , such as : intellectual property rights , fraud and other rights . We can ( and you authorize us to ) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other govern- ment o\ufb03cials as we , in our sole discretion , believe necessary or appropriate , in connection with an investigation of fraud , intel- lectual property infringements , or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.33 This policy gives eBay almost complete discretion to provide the gov- ernment with whatever information it deems appropriate . Truste.com , a nonpro\ufb01t organization providing a \u201c trustmark \u201d for participating websites that agree to abide by certain privacy princi- ples , has drafted a model privacy statement that reads : \u201c We will not sell , share , or rent [ personal ] information to others in ways di\ufb00erent from what is disclosed in this statement. \u201d 34 The statement then says that information may be shared with \u201c an outside shipping company to ship orders , and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. \u201d Personal data is also shared with third parties when the user signs up for services that are provided by those third parties . This policy , however , does not contain any provision about supplying information to the government . Further , the policy does not inform people that under existing law , information must be dis- closed to the government pursuant to a subpoena or court order . The government is also increasing information \ufb02ow from the pri- vate sector by encouraging it to develop new information gathering technologies . Private-sector \ufb01rms stand to pro\ufb01t from developing such technologies . Since September \uf731\uf731 , companies have expressed an eagerness to develop national identi\ufb01cation systems and face- recognition technology.35 In addition , the federal government has announced a \u201c wish list \u201d for new surveillance and investigation tech- nologies.36 Companies that invent such technologies can obtain lu- crative government contracts . \u25b2 g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g The government has also funded private-sector information gath- ering initiatives . For instance , a company that began assembling a national database of photographs and personal information as a tool to guard against consumer fraud has received $ \uf731.\uf735 million from the Secret Service to aid in the development of the database.37 In certain circumstances , where institutions do not willingly coop- erate with the government , the law requires their"}]}

For example , the Bank Secrecy Act of \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730 forces banks to maintain records of \ufb01nancial transactions to facilitate law enforcement needs\u2014in particular , investigations and prosecutions of criminal , tax , or regulatory matters.38 All federally insured banks must keep records of each customer \u2019 s \ufb01nancial transactions and must report to the government every \ufb01nancial transaction in excess of $ \uf731\uf730 , \uf730\uf730\uf730.39 The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf736 requires employers to report personal information from all new employees including SSNs , addresses , and wages.40 The Communica- tions Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf734 requires telecom- munications service providers to develop technology to assist government surveillance of individuals.41 Passed in \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731 , the USA-PA- TRIOT Act authorizes the FBI to obtain a court order to inspect or seize \u201c books , records , papers , documents , or other items \u201d for use in an investigation for terrorism or intelligence activities.42 This provi- sion contains a gag order , prohibiting anybody from disclosing that the FBI has sought or obtained anything.43 All of this suggests that businesses and government have become allies . When their interests diverge , the law forces cooperation . The government can increasingly amass gigantic dossiers on millions of individuals , conduct sweeping investigations , and search for vast quantities of information from a wide range of sources , without any probable cause or particularized suspicion . Information is easier to obtain , and it is becoming more centralized . The government is in- creasingly gaining access to the information in our digital dossiers . As Justice Douglas noted in his dissent when the Court upheld the con- stitutionality of the Bank Secrecy Act : These [ bank records ] are all tied to one \u2019 s SSN ; and now that we have the data banks , these other items will enrich that store- g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g \u25b2 house and make it possible for a bureaucrat\u2014by pushing one button\u2014to get in an instant the names of the \uf731\uf739\uf730 million Ameri- cans who are subversives or potential and likely candidates.44 Thus , we are increasingly seeing collusion , partly voluntary , partly coerced , between the private sector and the government . While pub- lic attention has focused on the Total Information Awareness project , the very same goals and techniques of the program continue to be carried out less systematically by various government agencies and law enforcement o\ufb03cials . We are already closer to Total Information Awareness than we might think .

I turn \ufb01rst to the Orwellian dangers . Creeping toward Totalitarianism . Historically , totalitarian governments have developed elaborate systems for collecting data about people \u2019 s private lives.45 Although the possibility of the rise of a totalitarian state is remote , if our society takes on certain totalitarian features , it could signi\ufb01cantly increase the extent to which the government can exer- cise social control . Justice Brandeis was prescient when he observed that people \u201c are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers . The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in the insidi- ous encroachment by men of zeal , well-meaning but without under- standing. \u201d 46 Democracy and Self-Determination . Even if government entities are not attempting to engage in social control , their activities can have col- lateral e\ufb00ects that harm democracy and self-determination . Paul Schwartz illustrates this with his theory of \u201c constitutive privacy. \u201d Ac- cording to Schwartz , privacy is essential to both individuals and \u25b2 g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g communities : \u201c [ C ] onstitutive privacy seeks to create boundaries about personal information to help the individual and de\ufb01ne terms of life within the community. \u201d As a form of regulation of information \ufb02ow , privacy shapes \u201c the extent to which certain actions or expres- sions of identity are encouraged or discouraged. \u201d Schwartz contends that extensive government oversight over an individual \u2019 s activities can \u201c corrupt individual decision making about the elements of one \u2019 s identity. \u201d 47 Likewise , Julie Cohen argues that a \u201c realm of autonomous , unmonitored choice . . . promotes a vital diversity of speech and be- havior. \u201d The lack of privacy \u201c threatens not only to chill the expression of eccentric individuality , but also , gradually , to dampen the force of our aspirations to it. \u201d 48 Freedom of Association . Government information collection interferes with an individual \u2019 s freedom of association . The Court has held that there is a \u201c vital relationship between freedom to associate and pri- vacy in one \u2019 s associations. \u201d 49 In a series of cases , the Court has re- stricted the government \u2019 s ability to compel disclosure of membership in an organization.50 In Baird v. State Bar,51 for example , the Court has declared : \u201c [ W ] hen a State attempts to make inquiries about a person \u2019 s beliefs or associations , its power is limited by the First Amendment .

Extensive government information gathering from third party records also implicates the right to speak anonymously . In Tal- ley v. California , the Court struck down a law prohibiting the distribu- tion of anonymous handbills as a violation of the First Amendment . The Court held that \u201c [ p ] ersecuted groups and sects from time to time throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices and laws either anonymously or not at all. \u201d Further , the Court rea- soned , \u201c identi\ufb01cation and fear of reprisal might deter perfectly peaceful discussions of public matters of importance. \u201d 54 The Court g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g \u25b2 has reiterated its view of the importance of protecting anonymous speech in subsequent cases.55 From third parties , especially ISPs , the government can readily obtain an anonymous or pseudonymous speaker \u2019 s identity . Only computer-savvy users can speak with more secure anonymity . Although private parties attempting to identify an anonymous speaker through subpoenas have been required to satisfy heightened standards,56 no such heightened standards have yet been applied when the government seeks to obtain the information . Further , beyond typical anonymity is the ability to receive informa- tion anonymously . As Julie Cohen persuasively contends : \u201c The free- dom to read anonymously is just as much a part of our tradition , and the choice of reading materials just as expressive of identity , as the decision to use or withhold one \u2019 s name. \u201d 57 The lack of su\ufb03cient con- trols on the government \u2019 s obtaining the extensive records about how individuals surf the web , the books and magazines they read , and the videos or television channels they listen to can implicate this interest . Additionally , the increasing information \ufb02ow between the private sector and the government not only impacts the privacy of the target of an investigation , but can also a\ufb00ect the privacy of other individu- als . The names , addresses , phone numbers , and a variety of data about a number of individuals can be ensnared in records pertaining to the target . These types of harms can inhibit individuals from associating with particular people and groups and from expressing their views , espe- cially unpopular ones . This kind of inhibition is a central goal of Or- well \u2019 s Big Brother . Although it certainly does not approach the same degree of oppressiveness as Big Brother , it reduces the robustness of dissent and weakens the vitality of our communication . The Kafkaesque Dangers The second general type of danger promoted by government infor- mation gathering consists of the harms routinely arising in bureau- cratic settings"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": decisions without adequate accountability , dangerous pockets of unfettered discretion , and choices based on short-term goals without consideration of the long-term consequences or the larger social e\ufb00ects . These bureaucratic harms have similarities to \u25b2 g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g those I discussed earlier when discussing the Kafka metaphor , al- though these harms take on some new dimensions with government law enforcement bureaucracy . As in Kafka \u2019 s The Trial , dossiers circu- late throughout a large government bureaucracy , and individuals are not informed how their information is used and how decisions are made based on their data . The existence of dossiers of personal infor- mation in government bureaucracies can lead to dangers such as hasty judgment in times of crisis , the disparate impact of law enforce- ment on particular minorities , cover-ups , petty retaliation for criti- cism , blackmail , framing , sweeping and disruptive investigations , racial or religious pro\ufb01ling , and so on . The most frequent problem is not that law enforcement agencies will be led by corrupt and abusive leaders , although this arguably happened for nearly \uf735\uf730 years when J. Edgar Hoover directed the FBI . The problem is the risk that judgment will not be exercised in a care- ful and thoughtful manner . In other words , it stems from certain forms of government information collection shifting power toward a bureaucratic machinery that is poorly regulated and susceptible to abuse . This shift has profound social e\ufb00ects because it alters the bal- ance of power between the government and the people , exposing in- dividuals to a series of harms , increasing their vulnerability and decreasing the degree of power they exercise over their lives . When the Fourth Amendment was rati\ufb01ed , organized police forces did not exist.58 Colonial policing was the \u201c business of amateurs. \u201d 59 Sheri\ufb00s did not have a professional sta\ufb00 ; they relied heavily on ordi- nary citizens to serve as constables or watchmen , whose primary duties consisted of patrolling rather than investigating.60 The govern- ment typically became involved in criminal investigations only after an arrest was made or a suspect was identi\ufb01ed , and in ordinary crimi- nal cases , police rarely conducted searches prior to arrest.61 Organized police forces developed during the nineteenth century , and by the middle of the twentieth century , policing reached an un- precedented level of organization and coordination.62 At the center of the rise of modern law enforcement was the development of the FBI . When the FBI was being formed in \uf731\uf739\uf730\uf738 , there was signi\ufb01cant opposi- tion in Congress to a permanent federal police force.63 Members of Congress expressed trepidation over the possibility that such an in- g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r"}]}

Today , we live in an endless matrix of law and regulation , adminis- tered by a multitude of vast government bureaucracies .

There are massive agencies devoted entirely to investigation and intelligence gathering . One of the distinctive facets of law enforcement bureaucracy in the United States is that low-ranking o\ufb03cials exercise a profound degree of discretion , and most of their discretionary decisions are undocu- mented.65 Many factors make it di\ufb03cult for law enforcement o\ufb03cials to strike a delicate balance between order and liberty . Among them , there are tremendous pressures on law enforcement agencies to capture crimi- nals , solve notorious crimes , keep crime under control , and prevent acts of violence and terrorism . This highly stressful environment can lead to short cuts , bad exercises of discretion , or obliviousness and in- sensitivity to people \u2019 s freedom . One of the most crucial aspects of keeping government power under control is a healthy scrutiny . Most law enforcement o\ufb03cials , however , are unlikely to view themselves with distrust and skepticism . Police and prosecutors are too en- veloped in the tremendous responsibilities and pressures of their jobs to remain completely unbiased . In short , one need not fear the rise of a totalitarian state or the in- hibition of democratic activities to desire strong controls on the power of the government in collecting personal information . The Kafka metaphor more aptly captures what is harmful about these types of bureaucratic realities . The harm is that our personal data is stored within a bureaucratic system , where we are vulnerable to abuses , careless errors , and thoughtless decisions . Leaks , Lapses , and Vulnerability . As more private-sector data becomes available to the government , there could be a de facto national \u25b2 g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g database , or a large database of \u201c suspicious \u201d individuals.66 Federal governmental entities have engaged in extensive data gathering cam- paigns on various political groups throughout the twentieth century . From \uf731\uf739\uf734\uf730 through \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf733 , for example , the FBI and CIA conducted a se- cret domestic intelligence operation , reading the mail of thousands of citizens .

During the Mc- Carthy era and again in the \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf730s , the FBI sought information from libraries about the reading habits of certain individuals . Between \uf731\uf739\uf736\uf737 and \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730 , the U.S. Army conducted wide-ranging surveillance , amass- ing extensive personal information about a broad group of individu- als . The impetus for the Army \u2019 s surveillance was a series of riots that followed Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. \u2019 s assassination . The information collected involved data about \ufb01nances , sexual activity , and health . In \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730 , Congress signi\ufb01cantly curtailed the Army \u2019 s program , and the records of personal information were eventually destroyed.67 The danger of these information warehousing e\ufb00orts is not only that it chills speech or threatens lawful protest , but also that it makes people more vulnerable by exposing them to potential future dangers such as leaks , security lapses , and improper arrests . For example , dur- ing the late \uf731\uf739\uf736\uf730s and early \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730s , the Philadelphia Police Department ( PPD ) compiled about \uf731\uf738 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 \ufb01les on various dissident individuals and groups . During a national television broadcast , PPD o\ufb03cials dis- closed the names of some of the people on whom \ufb01les were kept.68 Automated Investigations and Profiling . Government agencies are using personal information in databases to conduct automated investiga- tions . In \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf737 , in order to detect fraud , the federal government began matching its computer employee records with those of people receiv- ing federal bene\ufb01ts.69 With the use of computers to match records of di\ufb00erent government entities , the government investigated millions of people . Some matching programs used data obtained from mer- chants and marketers to discover tax , welfare , and food stamp fraud as well as to identify drug couriers.70 This sharing of records between di\ufb00erent government agencies , ordinarily a violation of the Privacy g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g \u25b2 Act , was justi\ufb01ed under the \u201c routine use \u201d exception.71 Computer matching raised signi\ufb01cant concerns , and in \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf738 , Congress \ufb01nally passed a law regulating this practice.72 The law has been strongly criti- cized as providing scant substantive guidance and having little practi- cal e\ufb00ect.73 This type of automated investigation is troubling because it alters the way that government investigations typically take place . Usually , the government has some form of particularized suspicion , a factual basis to believe that a particular person may be engaged in illegal conduct .

Pro\ufb01les can be based on stereotypes , race , or religion . A pro\ufb01le is only as good as its designer . Pro\ufb01les are often kept secret , enabling prejudices and faulty assumptions to exist unchecked by the public . As Oscar Gandy observes , the use of pro\ufb01ling to form pre- dictive models of human behavior incorrectly assumes that \u201c the identity of the individual can be reduced , captured , or represented by measurable characteristics. \u201d Pro\ufb01ling is an \u201c inherently conservative \u201d technology because it \u201c tends to reproduce and reinforce assessments and decisions made in the past. \u201d 75 Spiros Simitis explains that a pro\ufb01led individual is \u201c necessarily labeled and henceforth seen as a member of a group , the peculiar features of which are assumed to constitute her personal characteristics .

These initial roundups were facilitated by an index of potentially subversive peo- ple of Japanese descent compiled by the Justice Department begin- ning in the late \uf731\uf739\uf733\uf730s . In \uf731\uf739\uf734\uf732 , in the name of national security , about \uf731\uf732\uf730 , \uf730\uf730\uf730 people of Japanese descent living on the West Coast were im- prisoned in internment camps . The Census Bureau prepared special tabulations of Japanese Americans , which assisted in the relocation.80 The acquisition of personal data also facilitated the Palmer Raids ( or \u201c Red Scare \u201d ) of \uf731\uf739\uf731\uf739\u2013\uf731\uf739\uf732\uf730 .

McCarthy , the \ufb01gure who epitomized the anti-Communism of the \uf731\uf739\uf735\uf730s , received substantial assistance from Hoover , who secretly released information about sus- pected Communists to McCarthy.90 Further , the FBI supplied a steady \u25b2 g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g stream of names of individuals to be called before the House Un- American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) .91 As historian Richard Pow- ers observes , \u201c information derived from the [ FBI \u2019 s ] \ufb01les was clearly the lifeblood of the Washington anti-communist establishment. \u201d 92 The FBI also leaked information about suspected individuals to em- ployers and the press.93 Public accusations of being a Communist car- ried an immense stigma and often resulted in a severe public backlash.94 Individuals exposed as Communists faced retaliation in the private sector . Numerous journalists , professors , and entertainers were \ufb01red from their jobs and blacklisted from future employment.95 In short , government entities have demonstrated substantial abili- ties to gather and store personal information . Combined with the ex- tensive data available about individuals in third party records , this creates a recipe for similar or greater government abuses in the fu- ture . Changing Purposes and Uses . Information obtained by the government for one purpose can readily be used for another . For example , sup- pose the government is investigating whether a prominent critic of the war against terrorism has in any way assisted terrorists or is en- gaged in terrorism .

Further , dossiers maintained by law enforcement organizations can be selectively leaked to attack critics . Indeed , it is not far-fetched for government o\ufb03cials to amass data for use in silencing or attacking enemies , critics , undesirables , or rad- icals . For example , J. Edgar Hoover accumulated an extensive collec- tion of \ufb01les with detailed information about the private lives of numerous prominent individuals , including presidents , members of Congress , Supreme Court justices , celebrities , civil rights leaders , and attorney generals.96 Hoover \u2019 s data often included sexual activities.97 Hoover used this information to blackmail people or to destroy their reputations by leaking it . Often , however , he did not even have to g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g \u25b2 make any explicit threats .

Data that is ob- tained for one purpose can be used for an entirely di\ufb00erent purpose as motives change . For example , for several years , the FBI extensively wiretapped Martin Luther King , Jr.99 They wiretapped his home , his o\ufb03ce , and the hotel rooms that he stayed at when traveling.100 Based on the wiretaps , the FBI learned of his extensive partying , extramari- tal a\ufb00airs , and other sexual activities . A high-level FBI o\ufb03cial even anonymously sent him a tape with highlights of the FBI \u2019 s recordings , along with a letter that stated : King , there is only one thing left for you to do .

As I discussed in chapter \uf736 , we should move away from the invasion conception and seek to protect privacy through architectural solutions that regulate power in our various re- lationships . Protecting privacy through architecture di\ufb00ers from pro- tecting it as an individual right . Viewing privacy as an individual right against government information gathering conceives of the harm to privacy as emanating from the invasion into the lives of particular people . But many of the people asserting a right to privacy against government information gathering are criminals or terrorists , people we do not have a strong desire to protect . In modern Fourth Amend- ment law , privacy protection is often initiated at the behest of speci\ufb01c individuals , typically those accused of crimes . Often these individu- als \u2019 rights con\ufb02ict with the need for e\ufb00ective law enforcement and the protection of society . Why should one individual \u2019 s preference for pri- vacy trump the social goals of security and safety ? This question is di\ufb03cult to answer if privacy is understood as a right possessed by particular people . In contrast , architecture protects privacy di\ufb00erently and is based on a di\ufb00erent conception of privacy . Privacy is not merely a right pos- sessed by individuals , but is a form of freedom built into the social structure . It is thus an issue about the common good as much as it is about individual rights . It is an issue about social architecture , about the relationships that form the structure of our society . One might dismiss the abuses of government information gather- ing as caused by a few rogue o\ufb03cials . But according to David Garrow , the FBI that targeted Martin Luther King , Jr. was not a \u201c deviant insti- tution in American society , but actually a most representative and faithful one. \u201d 106 In other words , the FBI re\ufb02ected"}]}

Abuse is made possible by a bu- reaucratic machinery that is readily susceptible to manipulation . Thus , the problem lies in institutional structures and architectures of g o v e r n m e n t i n f o r m a t i o n g a t h e r i n g \u25b2 power . In the latter half of the twentieth century , and continuing to the present , one of the aspects of this architecture has been the lack of control over government information gathering . What is the most e\ufb00ective architecture to structure the way that the government can access personal information held by third parties ? In the next chapter , I discuss two architectures , that of the Fourth Amendment , which the Court has concluded doesn \u2019 t apply to data held by third parties , and that of the statutory regime which has arisen in its place . T h e F o u r t h A m e n d m e n t , Re c o r d s , a n d Pr i v a c y The Architecture of the Fourth Amendment The Purposes and Structure of the Fourth Amendment . For better or for worse , we currently regulate law enforcement in the United States with a constitutional regime , comprised primarily by the Fourth , Fifth , and Sixth Amendments . A signi\ufb01cant part of this regime applies to government information gathering . The Fifth Amendment a\ufb00ords individuals a privilege against being compelled to testify about in- criminating information . The Fourth Amendment regulates the gov- ernment \u2019 s power to obtain information through searches and seizures . Speci\ufb01cally , the Amendment provides : The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , pa- pers , and e\ufb00ects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon prob- able cause , supported by oath or a\ufb03rmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized.1 Although the Fourth Amendment applies to government activity in both the civil and criminal contexts,2 it is limited to activities that constitute \u201c searches \u201d and \u201c seizures. \u201d Certain activities , such as seeing things exposed openly to public view , are not searches.3 The Fourth 188 \u25b2 t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p r i v a c y \u25b2 Amendment"}]}

To obtain a warrant , the police must demonstrate to a neutral judge or magistrate that they have \u201c probable cause , \u201d which means they must provide \u201c reasonably trustworthy information \u201d that the search will reveal evidence of a crime.5 Generally , searches and seizures with- out a warrant are per se unreasonable\u2014which means that they are deemed invalid.6 This has become known as the \u201c per se warrant rule. \u201d 7 The Court has made numerous exceptions to the per se warrant rule.8 For example , the Court held in Terry v. Ohio that the police could stop and frisk an individual without a warrant or probable cause.9 Further , the Court has held that \u201c special needs \u201d in schools and workplaces make the warrant and probable cause requirements im- practicable.10 In the words of legal scholars Silas Wasserstrom and Louis Michael Seidman , the per se warrant rule \u201c is so riddled with ex- ceptions , complexities , and contradictions that it has become a trap for the unwary. \u201d 11 The Fourth Amendment is enforced primarily through the exclu- sionary rule . Evidence obtained in violation of the Amendment must be excluded from trial.12 Without the exclusionary rule , Justice Holmes observed , the Fourth Amendment would be a mere \u201c form of words. \u201d 13 According to law professor Arnold Loewy : \u201c The exclusionary rule protects innocent people by eliminating the incentive to search and seize unreasonably. \u201d 14 The exclusionary rule , however , has long been a sore spot in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence , engendering extensive debate over its desirability and e\ufb03cacy.15 Fourth Amendment Scope : Privacy . As applied by the Court , the Fourth Amendment has focused on protecting against invasions of privacy,16 although some commentators contend this focus is misguided . Ac- cording to legal scholar William Stuntz , criminal procedure is \u201c \ufb01rmly anchored in a privacy value that had already proved inconsistent with \u25b2 t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p r i v a c y the modern state. \u201d 17 For Stuntz , privacy vis-\u00e0-vis the government is impracticable given the rise of the administrative state , with its exten- sive health and welfare regulation .

Although designed to expand Fourth Amendment protection , privacy has \u201c turned out to contain the seeds for the later contraction of Fourth Amendment rights. \u201d 21 \u201c The Fourth Amendment as a privacy-focused doctrine has not fared well with the changing times of an increasingly nonprivate world and a judicial re- luctance to expand individual rights. \u201d 22 However , Sundby assumes that \u201c privacy \u201d means what the Court says it means . Many current problems in Fourth Amendment ju- risprudence stem from the Court \u2019 s failure to conceptualize privacy adequately , both in method and substance . Methodologically , the Court has attempted to adhere to a uni\ufb01ed conception of privacy . Conceptualizing privacy by attempting to isolate its essence or com- mon denominator has inhibited the Court from conceptualizing pri- vacy in a way that can adapt to changing technology and social practices.23 Substantively , the Court originally conceptualized privacy in physical terms as protecting tangible property or preventing tres- passes . The Court then shifted to viewing privacy with the secrecy paradigm . In each of these conceptual paradigms , the Court has rigidly adhered to a single narrow conception and has lost sight of the Fourth Amendment \u2019 s larger purposes . In contrast , I contend that the Fourth Amendment provides for an architecture , a structure of protection that safeguards a range of di\ufb00- erent social practices of which privacy forms an integral dimension . Those like Stuntz and Sundby who contend that the Fourth Amend- ment should not concern itself with privacy fail to see the importance t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p r i v a c y \u25b2 of privacy in the relationship between the government and the Peo- ple . The private life is a critical point for the exercise of power . Privacy shields aspects of our lives and social practices where people feel vul- nerable , uneasy , and fragile , where social norms and judgment are particularly oppressive and abrasive . It is also implicated when infor- mation relates to our basic needs and desires : \ufb01nances , employment , entertainment , political activity , sexuality , and family . Indeed , the great distopian novels of the twentieth century\u2014George Orwell \u2019 s 1984 , Aldous Huxley \u2019 s Brave New World , and Franz Kafka \u2019 s The Trial\u2014 all illustrate how"}]}

Although Stuntz contends that the Fourth Amendment must for- sake privacy because of the rise of the administrative state , this is the very reason why protecting privacy is imperative . The administrative state threatens to equip the government with excessive power that could destroy the Framers \u2019 careful design to ensure that the power of the People remains the strongest.24 In particular , the extensive power of modern bureaucracies over individuals depends in signi\ufb01cant part on the collection and use of personal information . While Stuntz is correct that the Fourth Amendment should not be cabined exclu- sively to protecting privacy and should address other values such as coercion and violence , he errs in treating privacy and police coercion as mutually exclusive.25 Robust Fourth Amendment protection need not be inconsistent with the administrative state , as a signi\ufb01cant amount of modern ad- ministrative regulation concerns business and commercial activities which lack Fourth Amendment rights equivalent to those guaranteed to individuals.26 Stuntz retorts that for individuals to have a meaning- ful protection of privacy , they must be provided with privacy within institutions , which \u201c is almost the same as giving the institution itself a protectible privacy interest. \u201d 27 Beyond this , Stuntz contends , \u201c a great deal of government information gathering targets individuals , \u201d such as the information that is gathered in tax forms.28 However , one need not adopt an all-or-nothing approach to Fourth Amendment privacy . The Fourth Amendment does not categorically prohibit the govern- ment from compelling certain disclosures by individuals or institu- tions . If it did , then the tax system and much corporate regulation \u25b2 t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p r i v a c y would be nearly impossible to administer . But the fact that the gov- ernment can compel certain disclosures does not mean that it can compel people to disclose the details of their sexual lives or require them to send in their diaries along with their tax forms . The govern- ment \u2019 s power to inspect factories for safety violations does not mean that the government should be able to search every employee \u2019 s o\ufb03ce , locker , or bag . Therefore , although misconceptualizing privacy , the Court has correctly made it a focal point of the Fourth Amendment . Fourth Amendment Structure : Warrants . Before eroding it with dozens of exceptions , the Court made the Fourth Amendment \u2019 s warrant re- quirement one of the central mechanisms to ensure that the govern- ment was responsibly exercising its powers of information collection .

Merely looking to colonial precedents is insu\ufb03cient , because the Fourth Amendment did not follow colonial precedents ( since general searches were rampant ) but rejected them.32 My aim , however , is not to quarrel about original in- tent . Even if Amar is right about the Framers \u2019 intent , warrants are an important device in our times since , as Scott Sundby observes , \u201c the Founders could not have foreseen the technological and regulatory reach of government intrusions that exists today. \u201d 33 The warrant requirement embodies two important insights of the Framers that particularly hold true today . First , the warrant require- ment aims to prevent searches from turning into \u201c \ufb01shing expedi- tions. \u201d 34 Accordingly , the warrant clause circumscribes searches and t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p r i v a c y \u25b2 seizures . As the Fourth Amendment states , a warrant must describe with \u201c particular [ ity ] . . . the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. \u201d 35 The Framers included the warrant clause because of their experi- ence with writs of assistance and general warrants.36 A writ of assis- tance was a document that allowed British customs o\ufb03cials to force local o\ufb03cials and even private citizens to search and seize prohibited goods.37 Writs of assistance didn \u2019 t need to specify a particular person or place to be targeted ; anyone could be searched under their author- ity ; and they resulted in \u201c sweeping searches and seizures without any evidentiary basis. \u201d 38 Like writs of assistance , general warrants had a very broad scope , and they did not need to mention speci\ufb01c individu- als to target or speci\ufb01c locations to be searched . They \u201c resulted in \u2018 ransacking \u2019 and seizure of the personal papers of political dissenters , authors , and printers of seditious libel. \u201d 39 As Patrick Henry declared : \u201c They may , unless the general government be restrained by a bill of rights , or some similar restrictions , go into your cellars and rooms , and search , ransack , and measure , everything you eat , drink , and wear ."}]}

Writing about separation of powers in Federalist No . 51 , Madison observed : But what is government itself but the greatest of all re\ufb02ections on human nature ? If men were angels , no government would be necessary . If angels were to govern men , neither external nor in- ternal controuls on government would be necessary . In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men , the great di\ufb03culty lies in this : You must \ufb01rst enable the government to controul the governed ; and in the next place , oblige it to con- troul itself . A dependence on the people is no doubt the primary controul on the government ; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.41 The profound insight of Madison and the Framers was that by sep- arating government powers between di\ufb00erent entities and pitting \u25b2 t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p r i v a c y them against each other , government could be controlled . As legal scholar Raymond Ku aptly observes , the Framers adopted the Fourth Amendment based on concerns about limiting executive power.42 Madison was acutely aware that the \u201c parchment barriers \u201d of the Con- stitution would fail to check government encroachments of power , and he explained how both the legislative and executive branches could overstep their bounds.43 He arrived at an architectural solution : Power should be di\ufb00used among di\ufb00erent departments of govern- ment , each a\ufb00orded \u201c the necessary constitutional means , and per- sonal motives , to resist encroachments of the others. \u201d Government will be kept in check only if its parts consist of \u201c opposite and rival in- terests. \u201d 44 As historian Gordon Wood describes the Madisonian vision : It was an imposing conception\u2014a kinetic theory of politics\u2014 such a crumbling of political and social interests , such an atom- ization of authority , such a parceling of power , not only in the governmental institutions but in the extended sphere of the soci- ety itself , creating such a multiplicity and a scattering of designs and passions , so many checks , that no combination of parts could hold , no group of evil interests could long cohere . Yet out of the clashing and checking of this diversity , Madison believed the public good , the true perfection of the whole , would some- how arise.45 The warrant requirement re\ufb02ects Madison \u2019 s philosophy of govern- ment power by inserting the judicial branch in the middle of the exec- utive branch \u2019 s investigation process.46 Although warrants have been"}]}

This was done neither to shield crimi- nals nor to make the home a safe haven for illegal activities . It was done so that an objective mind might weigh the need to in- vade that privacy in order to enforce the law . The right of privacy was deemed too precious to entrust to the discretion of those whose job is the detection of crime and the arrest of criminals . Power is a heady thing ; and history shows that the police acting on their own can not be trusted . And so the Constitution requires a magistrate to pass on the desires of the police before they vio- late the privacy of the home.50 Further , the requirement of prior approval prevents government o\ufb03cials from \u201c dreaming up post hoc rationalizations \u201d 51 and judges from experiencing hindsight bias when evaluating the propriety of a search after it has taken place.52 My purpose is not to defend the existing structure of the Fourth Amendment as perfect . For the purposes of this discussion , it is su\ufb03- cient to agree ( \uf731 ) that the Fourth Amendment regime serves an impor- tant function by establishing an architecture that aims to protect privacy in addition to other values , and ( \uf732 ) that one of the central fea- tures of this architecture requires neutral and external oversight of the executive branch \u2019 s power to gather and use personal information .

The Shifting Paradigms of Fourth Amendment Privacy Some notion of privacy has always been the trigger for Fourth Amendment protection , at least since the late nineteenth century . In \uf731\uf738\uf738\uf736 , in Boyd v. United States,53 an early case delineating the meaning \u25b2 t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p r i v a c y of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments , the government attempted to subpoena a person \u2019 s private papers for use in a civil forfeiture pro- ceeding . The Court held that the subpoena violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments , since it invaded the individual \u2019 s \u201c indefeasible right of personal security , personal liberty and private property. \u201d 54 Commentators have characterized Boyd as protecting property and as consistent with the exaltation of property and contract during the Lochner era.55 The Lochner era was a period of Supreme Court ju- risprudence lasting from about \uf731\uf738\uf739\uf739 through \uf731\uf739\uf733\uf737 . The case that epit- omized this era was Lochner v. New York , where the Court struck down a law restricting the number of hours that bakery employees could work to \uf736\uf730 a week . The Court concluded that the law infringed upon the constitutional guarantee of liberty of contract.56 When the Court also nulli\ufb01ed many other progressive laws and New Deal statutes for similar reasons , it was denounced for adhering too strictly to an ideology of laissez faire and unbridled commercial activity.57 Although Boyd certainly furthers the ideology of the Lochner Court , it should not merely be dismissed as the product of Lochner-like ac- tivism . Boyd follows a conception of privacy that the Court consis- tently adhered to in the late nineteenth century and the \ufb01rst half of the twentieth century . Under this conception , the Court viewed inva- sions of privacy as a type of physical incursion . For example , nine years prior to Boyd , in \uf731\uf738\uf737\uf737 , the Court held in Ex Parte Jackson that the Fourth Amendment applied to the opening of letters sent through the postal system : \u201c The constitutional guaranty of the right of the people to be secure in their papers against unreasonable searches and seizures extends to their papers , thus closed against inspection , wherever they may be. \u201d 58 Additionally , privacy also concerned physi- cal bodily intrusions . In Union Paci\ufb01c Railway Company v. Botsford , an \uf731\uf738\uf739\uf731 case concerning privacy but not directly involving the Fourth Amendment , the Court held that a court could not compel a female plainti\ufb00 in a civil action to submit to a surgical examination : The inviolability of the person is as much invaded by a compul- sory stripping and exposure as by a blow . To compel any one , and especially a"}]}

Indeed , in \uf731\uf738\uf739\uf730 , when Warren and Brandeis authored their famous article The Right to Privacy , they observed that the law , which had long recognized physical and tangible injuries , was just beginning to recognize incorporeal ones.60 Warren and Brandeis ar- gued that privacy was more than simply a physical intrusion , a view increasingly recognized in the common law of torts in the early twentieth century . However , in its Fourth Amendment jurispru- dence , the Court held fast to its physical intrusion conception of privacy . The Court \u2019 s view that Fourth Amendment privacy constituted pro- tection from physical intrusions came to a head in \uf731\uf739\uf732\uf738 in Olmstead v. United States.61 There , the Court held that the tapping of a person \u2019 s home telephone outside a person \u2019 s house did not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment because it did not involve a trespass inside a per- son \u2019 s home : \u201c The Amendment does not forbid what was done here . There was no searching . There was no seizure . The evidence was se- cured by the use of the sense of hearing and that only . There was no entry of the houses or o\ufb03ces of the defendants. \u201d 62 Olmstead relied upon the Court \u2019 s physical intrusion conception of privacy . Since there was no trespassing , opening , or rummaging , there was no invasion of Fourth Amendment privacy . Justice Louis Brandeis vigorously dissented , chastising the Court for failing to adapt the Constitution to new problems . He observed : \u201c When the Fourth and Fifth Amendments were adopted , the form that evil had theretofore taken had been necessarily simple. \u201d 63 The government \u201c could secure possession of [ a person \u2019 s ] papers and other articles incident to his private life\u2014a seizure e\ufb00ected , if need be , by breaking and entry. \u201d 64 But technological developments , Brandeis ar- gued , have created new threats to privacy : \u25b2 t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p"}]}

Subtler and more far-reaching means of invading pri- vacy have become available to the government . Discovery and invention have made it possible for the government , by means far more e\ufb00ective than stretching upon the rack , to obtain dis- closure in court of what is whispered in the closet.65 The Court , however , continued to follow the Olmstead conception of privacy in subsequent cases . In Goldman v. United States , for exam- ple , the police placed a device called a \u201c detectaphone \u201d on the wall next to a person \u2019 s o\ufb03ce , enabling them to eavesdrop on the conversa- tions inside the o\ufb03ce . The Court concluded that since there had been no physical trespass into the o\ufb03ce , the Fourth Amendment had not been violated.66 In \uf731\uf739\uf736\uf737 , nearly \uf734\uf730 years after Olmstead , the Court in Katz v. United States \ufb01nally abandoned the physical intrusion conception of privacy and adopted the Fourth Amendment approach employed today . Katz involved the electronic eavesdropping of a telephone conversation made by a person in a phone booth . Explicitly overruling Olmstead and Goldman , the Court declared : \u201c What a person knowingly exposes to the public , even in his own home or o\ufb03ce , is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection . But what he seeks to preserve as pri- vate , even in an area accessible to the public , may be constitutionally protected. \u201d 67 The Court \u2019 s approach to determining the applicability of the Fourth Amendment emerged from Justice Harlan \u2019 s concurrence in Katz . The \u201c reasonable expectation of privacy test \u201d looks to whether ( \uf731 ) a person exhibits an \u201c actual or subjective expectation of privacy \u201d and ( \uf732 ) \u201c the expectation [ is ] one that society is prepared to recognize as \u2018 reasonable. \u2019 \u201d 68 Brandeis \u2019 s dissent in Olmstead only partially won the day in Katz . Instead of adopting a conception of privacy that was adaptable to new technology , as the reasonable expectation of privacy test initially promised to be , the Court rigidi\ufb01ed its approach with a particular conception of privacy\u2014the secrecy paradigm . The Court based this new conception on the language in Katz that privacy turned on what a person exposed to the public . In this way , privacy was conceptual- t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p r i v a c y \u25b2 ized as a form of secrecy , and people couldn \u2019 t have a reasonable ex- pectation of privacy in information that was not kept secret . The full implications of this new conception of privacy are dis- cussed"}]}

Before turning to this issue , it is important to observe the e\ufb00ects of the Court \u2019 s failure to reconceptualize privacy in Olmstead . As a result of the nearly \uf734\uf730 years between Olmstead and Katz , there was little control over the burgeoning use of electronic surveillance , one of the most powerful technological law enforce- ment tools developed during the twentieth century . The Fourth Amendment stood by silently as this new technology proliferated . At the time of Olmstead , many viewed wiretapping with great un- ease . Justice Holmes called it a \u201c dirty business. \u201d 69 Even J. Edgar Hoover , who later became one of the greatest abusers of wiretapping , testi\ufb01ed in \uf731\uf739\uf732\uf739 that wiretapping was \u201c unethical \u201d and that he would \ufb01re any FBI employee who engaged in it.70 In \uf731\uf739\uf733\uf734 , just six years after Olmstead , Congress enacted \u00a7\uf736\uf730\uf735 of the Federal Communications Act , making wiretapping a federal crime . However , \u00a7\uf736\uf730\uf735 was practically impotent . It did not apply to wiretap- ping by state police or private parties . Nor did it apply to bugging . Further , it only precluded the disclosure of tapped communications in court proceedings.71 Thus , the FBI could wiretap so long as it didn \u2019 t try to use any of the results in court.72 Gradually , presidents gave the FBI increasing authority to wire- tap.73 In World War II , the FBI gained authorization to engage in wire- tapping the authorization expanded to encompass domestic security . The fear of communism during the \uf731\uf739\uf735\uf730s allowed the FBI to intensify its use of electronic surveillance.74 investigate national security threats . Later , to Widespread abuses began to occur . Hoover \u2019 s misconduct was egregious . He wiretapped critics of the FBI , enemies of his political allies , and practically anybody whose political views he disliked . As discussed earlier , he engaged in massive electronic surveillance of Martin Luther King , Jr. Presidents also misused the FBI \u2019 s wiretap- ping power for their own political purposes . President Nixon or- dered extensive wiretapping , including surveillance of his own speechwriter , William Sa\ufb01re.75 Presidents Kennedy and Johnson also ordered electronic surveillances inappropriately.76 With regard to \u25b2 t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p r i v a c y pre-Katz wiretapping by the states , an in\ufb02uential study led by Samuel Dash concluded that \uf739\uf730 percent of state wiretapping lacked court au- thorization and that state regulation of wiretapping had been largely ine\ufb00ective against abuses.77 Thus , for \uf734\uf730 years , the government \u2019 s power to engage in electronic surveillance fell outside of the reach of the Fourth Amendment , and the legislation that \ufb01lled the void was ine\ufb00ective .

The Court has made a mistake similar to Olmstead , and it is one with severe and far-reaching im- plications . The New Olmstead Although we have moved from the Olmstead physical intrusion con- ception of privacy to a new regime based upon expectations of pri- vacy , there is a new Olmstead , one that is just as shortsighted and rigid in approach . The Court \u2019 s new conception of privacy is the se- crecy paradigm . If any information is exposed to the public or if law enforcement o\ufb03cials can view something from any public vantage point , then the Court has refused to recognize a reasonable expecta- tion of privacy . For example , in Florida v. Riley , the Court held that a person did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his enclosed green- house because a few roof panels were missing and the police were able to \ufb02y over it with a helicopter.78 In California v. Greenwood , the police searched plastic garbage bags that the defendant had left on the curb to be collected by the trash collector . The Court held that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in the trash because \u201c [ i ] t is common knowledge that plastic bags left on or at the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals , children , scavengers , snoops , and other members of the public. \u201d 79 Trash is left at the curb \u201c for the express purpose of conveying it to a third party , the trash col- lector , who might himself have sorted through [ the ] trash or permit- ted others , such as the police , to do so. \u201d 80 Consistent with this conception of privacy , the Court held that there is no reasonable expectation in privacy for information known or exposed to third parties . In United States v. Miller , federal agents t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p r i v a c y \u25b2 presented subpoenas to two banks to produce the defendant \u2019 s \ufb01nan- cial records . The defendant argued that the Fourth Amendment re- quired a warrant , not a subpoena , but the Court concluded that the Amendment didn \u2019 t apply . There is no reasonable expectation of pri- vacy in the records , the Court reasoned , because the information is \u201c revealed to a third party. \u201d 81 Thus , \u201c checks are not con\ufb01dential com- munications but negotiable instruments to be used in commercial transactions . All of the documents obtained , including \ufb01nancial statements and deposit slips , contain only information voluntarily conveyed to the banks and exposed to their employees in the ordi- nary course of business. \u201d 82 The Court used similar"}]}

Without a warrant , the police asked a telephone company to use a pen register , which is a device installed at the phone company to record the num- bers dialed from the defendant \u2019 s home . The Court concluded that since people \u201c know that they must convey numerical information to the phone company , \u201d they can not \u201c harbor any general expectation that the numbers they dial will remain secret. \u201d 83 Miller and Smith establish a general rule that if information is in the hands of third parties , then an individual lacks a reasonable ex- pectation of privacy in that information , which means that the Fourth Amendment does not apply.84 Individuals thus probably do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in communications and records maintained by ISPs or computer network administrators.85 The third party record doctrine stems from the secrecy paradigm . If informa- tion is not completely secret , if it is exposed to others , then it loses its status as private . Smith and Miller have been extensively criticized throughout the past several decades . However , it is only recently that we are beginning to see the profound implications of the third party doctrine . Smith and Miller are the new Olmstead and Goldman . Gath- ering information from third party records is an emerging law en- forcement practice with as many potential dangers as the wiretapping in Olmstead . \u201c The progress of science in furnishing the government with means of espionage is not likely to stop with wire- tapping , \u201d Justice Brandeis observed in his Olmstead dissent . \u201c Ways may some day be developed by which the government , without re- moving papers from secret drawers , can reproduce them in court , \u25b2 t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p r i v a c y and by which it will be enabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home. \u201d 86 That day is here .

Unlike warrants , subpoenas do not re- quire probable cause and can be issued without judicial approval . Prosecutors , not neutral judicial o\ufb03cers , can issue subpoenas.88 Ac- cording to Stuntz : \u201c [ W ] hile searches typically require probable cause or reasonable suspicion and sometimes require a warrant , subpoenas require nothing , save that the subpoena not be unreasonably burden- some to its target . Few burdens are deemed unreasonable. \u201d 89 Accord- ing to legal scholar Ronald Degnan , subpoenas are not issued \u201c with great circumspection \u201d and are often \u201c handed out blank in batches and \ufb01lled in by lawyers. \u201d 90 As Stuntz contends , federal subpoena power is \u201c akin to a blank check. \u201d 91 Prosecutors can also use grand jury subpoenas to obtain third party records.92 Grand jury subpoenas are \u201c presumed to be reason- able \u201d and may only be quashed if \u201c there is no reasonable possibility t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p r i v a c y \u25b2 that the category of materials the Government seeks will produce in- formation relevant to the general subject of the grand jury investiga- tion. \u201d 93 As Stuntz observes , grand jury subpoenas \u201c are much less heavily regulated \u201d than search warrants : As long as the material asked for is relevant to the grand jury \u2019 s in- vestigation and as long as compliance with the subpoena is not too burdensome , the subpoena is enforced . No showing of prob- able cause or reasonable suspicion is necessary , and courts measure relevance and burden with a heavy thumb on the gov- ernment \u2019 s side of the scales.94 Therefore , courts \u201c quash or modify \u201d subpoenas only \u201c if compli- ance would be unreasonable or oppressive. \u201d 95 Further , \u201c judges decide these motions by applying vague legal standards case by case. \u201d 96 Court orders under most of the statutes are not much more con- strained than subpoenas . They typically require mere \u201c relevance \u201d to an ongoing criminal investigation , a standard signi\ufb01cantly lower and looser than probable cause . The problem with subpoenas and court orders is that they supply the judiciary with greatly attenuated oversight powers . The role of the judge in issuing or reviewing subpoenas is merely to determine whether producing records is overly burdensome .

In short , judicial involvement with subpoe- nas and court orders amounts to little more than a rubber stamp of judicial legitimacy . Wiretapping and Bugging . When the Court held in Olmstead that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to wiretapping , Congress re- sponded six years later by enacting \u00a7\uf736\uf730\uf735 of the Federal Communica- tions Act of \uf731\uf739\uf733\uf734 . As discussed earlier , \u00a7\uf736\uf730\uf735 was far too narrow and limited . In \uf731\uf739\uf736\uf738 , a year after the Court in Katz declared that the Fourth Amendment applied to wiretapping , Congress enacted Title III of the \u25b2 t h e f o u r t h a m e n d m e n t , r e c o r d s , a n d p r i v a c y Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act,97 which greatly strength- ened the law of wiretapping , extending its reach to state o\ufb03cials and private parties . In \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf736 , Congress amended Title III with the Elec- tronic Communications Privacy Act ( ECPA ) . The ECPA restructured Title III into three parts , known as the \u201c Wiretap Act , \u201d which governs the interception of communications ; the \u201c Stored Communications Act , \u201d which covers access to stored communications and records ; and the \u201c Pen Register Act , \u201d which regulates pen registers and trap and trace devices.98 The Wiretap Act covers wiretapping and bugging . It applies when a communication is intercepted during transmission . The Act has strict requirements for obtaining a court order to engage in electronic sur- veillance.99 In certain respects , the Wiretap Act \u2019 s requirements are stricter than those for a Fourth Amendment search warrant.100 It also requires that the surveillance \u201c minimize the interception of commu- nications \u201d not related to the investigation . The Act is enforced with an exclusionary rule.101 However , the interception of electronic communications not in- volving the human voice ( such as email ) is not protected with an ex- clusionary rule . Although the Wiretap Act has substantial protections , it covers ground already protected by the Fourth Amendment . In ar- eas not protected by the Fourth Amendment , the architecture of the statutory regime is much weaker and more porous . Stored Communications . Communications service providers frequently store their customers \u2019 communications . ISPs temporarily store email until it is downloaded by the recipient . Many ISPs enable users to keep copies of previously read email on the ISP \u2019 s server , as well as copies of their sent emails . Since a third party maintains the informa- tion , the Fourth Amendment may not apply.102 The Stored Communications Act provides some protection , but unfortunately it is quite"}]}

But what about previously read email that remains on the ISP \u2019 s server ?

Communications Service Records . The Stored Communications Act also regulates government access to a customer \u2019 s communications service records , which consist of the customer \u2019 s name , address , phone num- bers , payment information , and services used.106 One of the most im- portant pieces of information in ISP records is the customer \u2019 s identity . An ISP may have information linking a customer \u2019 s screen name to her real name . Thus , an ISP often holds the key to one \u2019 s abil- ity to communicate anonymously on the Internet . The government often wants to obtain this information to identify a particular speaker . To access customer records , the government must obtain a court order , which requires \u201c speci\ufb01c and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that . . . the records or other information sought , are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. \u201d 107 Further , since the Act lacks an exclusionary rule , information obtained in violation of the law can still be intro- duced in court.108 Pen Registers , Email Headers , and Websurfing . The Pen Register Act at- tempts to \ufb01ll the void left by Smith v. Maryland by requiring a court order to use a pen register or trap and trace device.109 Whereas a pen register records the phone numbers a person dials from her home , a trap and trace device creates a list of the telephone numbers of in- coming calls . The USA-PATRIOT Act , passed in \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731 shortly after the September \uf731\uf731th attacks , expanded the scope of the Pen Register Act .

Financial Records . Two years after United States v. Miller , Congress \ufb01lled the void with the Right to Financial Privacy Act ( RFPA ) of \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf738 , which requires the government to obtain a warrant or subpoena to access records from banks or other \ufb01nancial institutions.113 However , the subpoena merely requires a \u201c reason to believe that the records sought are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry. \u201d 114 When subpoena authority is not available to the government , the govern- ment need only submit a formal written request for the informa- tion.115 In addition to banks , credit reporting agencies have detailed records for nearly every adult American consumer . Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) of \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730 , a consumer reporting agency \u201c may furnish identifying information respecting any consumer , lim- ited to his name , address , former addresses , places of employment , or former places of employment , to a governmental agency. \u201d 116 Thus , the government can simply request this information without any court involvement .

Thus , the statutory regime merely provides partial protection of \ufb01nancial data . Electronic Media Entertainment Records . The statutory regime protects records pertaining to certain forms of electronic media entertain- ment . Under the Cable Communications Policy Act ( Cable Act ) of \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf734,118 a government o\ufb03cial must obtain a court order in order to ob- tain cable records . The government must o\ufb00er \u201c clear and convincing evidence that the subject of the information is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity and that the information sought would be material evidence in the case. \u201d 119 People can \u201c appear and contest \u201d the court order.120 This standard is more stringent than the Fourth Amendment \u2019 s probable cause and warrant requirements . However , there is no exclusionary rule under the Cable Act . In addition to cable records , the statutory regime also protects videotape rental records . The Video Privacy Protection Act ( VPPA ) of \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf738 states that a videotape service provider may disclose customer records to law enforcement o\ufb03cials \u201c pursuant to a warrant . . . , an equivalent State warrant , a grand jury subpoena , or a court order. \u201d 121 Unlike the Cable Act , the level of protection under the VPPA is much less stringent .

For example , records from music stores , electronics merchants , and Internet media entities are a\ufb00orded no protection . Medical Records . Our medical records are maintained by third parties . Could the third party doctrine extend to medical records ? On the one hand , given the considerable privacy protection endowed upon the patient-physician relationship , the third party doctrine may stop at the hospital door.122 On the other hand , the doctrine applies to records of \ufb01nancial institutions , which also have a tradition of main- taining the con\ufb01dentiality of their customers \u2019 information.123 Unless the patient-physician relationship is distinguished from banks , the third party doctrine logically could apply to medical records .

Only records maintained by health plans , health care clearinghouses , and health care providers are covered.126 Although doctors , hospitals , pharmacists , health insurers , and HMOs are covered , not all third parties possessing our medical information fall under HIPAA . For ex- ample , the sale of nonprescription drugs and the rendering of med- ical advice by many Internet health websites are not covered by HIPAA.127 Therefore , while certain health records are protected , others are not . Holes in the Regime . Federal statutes provide some coverage of the void left by the inapplicability of the Fourth Amendment to records held by third parties . Although the statutes apply to communication records , \ufb01nancial records , entertainment records , and health records , these are only protected when in the hands of particular third parties . Thus , the statutory regime does not protect records based on the type of information contained in the records , but protects them based on the particular types of third parties that possess them . Additionally , there are gaping holes in the statutory regime of pro- tection , with classes of records not protected at all . Such records in- clude those of merchants , both online and o\ufb04ine . Records held by bookstores , department stores , restaurants , clubs , gyms , employers , and other companies are not protected . Additionally , all the personal information amassed in pro\ufb01les by database companies is not cov- ered . Records maintained by Internet retailers and websites are often not considered \u201c communications \u201d under the ECPA ; the government can access these records and the ECPA doesn \u2019 t apply . Thus , the statu- tory regime is limited in its scope and has glaring omissions and gaps .

Re c o n s t r u c t i n g t h e A r c h i t e c t u r e Today , much of our personal information is \ufb01nding its way into the hands of third parties . Moreover , given the Court \u2019 s current conception of privacy under the Fourth Amendment , the architecture that regu- lates many of the government \u2019 s information gathering practices is in- creasingly that of a confusing and gap-riddled statutory regime . One solution to \ufb01ll the void is for the Court to reverse Smith v. Maryland and United States v. Miller . Although Fourth Amendment architecture is signi\ufb01cantly more protective than that of the statutory regime , the problem of how to regulate government access to third party records is not adequately addressed by Fourth Amendment ar- chitecture alone . As discussed earlier , the principal remedy for Fourth Amendment violations is the exclusionary rule , which prevents the government from introducing improperly obtained data during a criminal prosecution . However , many information acquisition abuses often occur in the absence of prosecutions . Therefore , the exclusion- ary rule alone is not su\ufb03ciently protective . A better architecture to regulate government information gather- ing from third parties should be constructed . In particular , such an 210 \u25b2 r e c o n s t r u c t i n g t h e a r c h i t e c t u r e \u25b2 architecture should prevent the types of problems associated with government information gathering discussed earlier in chapter \uf739 . An architecture should strive for three goals : minimization , particular- ization , and control . First , government information gathering should be minimized . Sweeping investigations and vast stores of personal data in the hands of government entities present signi\ufb01cant opportunities for the prob- lematic uses discussed earlier . Second , e\ufb00orts at amassing data should be particularized to speci\ufb01c individuals suspected of criminal involvement . Particulariza- tion requires law enforcement o\ufb03cials to exercise care in selecting the individuals who should be investigated , and it prevents dragnet investigations that primarily involve innocent people . One of the most important aspects of keeping the government under control is to prevent its investigatory powers from being turned loose on the population at large . Third , government information gathering and use must be con- trolled . There must be some meaningful form of supervision over the government \u2019 s information gathering activity to ensure that it remains minimized and particularized . The government \u2019 s use of information must be controlled to prevent abuses and security lapses . The aims of the architecture , however , are not the most di\ufb03cult is- sue .

What is the appropriate scope of an architecture that regulates government infor- mation gathering ?

In the early stages of an investigation , the police frequently talk to victims , witnesses , friends , and neighbors . The police often \ufb01nd out about a crime when people voluntarily report suspicious activity . These examples all involve third parties who possess information about the person being investigated . If the architecture encompasses all third parties , then it might unduly constrain police investigations . Consequently , a line must be drawn to distinguish the instances where third parties can voluntarily supply information to the govern- ment and where the government will be prohibited from accessing information . Although we may want to prevent Amazon.com from di- vulging to the government the log of books a person bought , we may not want to prohibit a person \u2019 s neighbor or a stranger from telling the police which books she happened to observe the person reading . Where should we draw the line ? One way is to focus on the type of data involved , distinguishing between \u201c private \u201d and \u201c nonprivate \u201d in- formation . The architecture would protect all personal information that is private . But how is privacy to be de\ufb01ned ? 1 Following the se- crecy paradigm , the Court has de\ufb01ned privacy as total secrecy . But this de\ufb01nition obviously doesn \u2019 t work since it would exclude informa- tion held by third parties . Another way to de\ufb01ne private information is to focus on \u201c intimate \u201d information . A number of commentators , such as philosophers Julie Inness and Tom Gerety , have contended that intimacy is the essential characteristic of privacy.2 But what constitutes \u201c intimate \u201d informa- tion ? Without an adequate de\ufb01nition , \u201c intimate \u201d becomes nothing more than a synonym for \u201c private. \u201d Some commentators , such as In- ness , de\ufb01ne \u201c intimacy \u201d as involving loving and caring relationships.3 However , much private information , such as \ufb01nancial and health data , doesn \u2019 t pertain to these types of relationships .

Easy distinctions such as intimate versus nonintimate and secret versus nonsecret fail to account for the complex nature of what is considered private . Privacy is a dimension of social practices , activ- ities , customs , and norms that are shaped by history and culture . The matters that are considered private and public have changed throughout history . Privacy is not an inherent property of particular r e c o n s t r u c t i n g t h e a r c h i t e c t u r e \u25b2 forms of information , since even the most sensitive and revealing in- formation is not private under all circumstances . Even if ordinarily a person \u2019 s sex life or medical history is private , it wouldn \u2019 t be private if that person were a public \ufb01gure who routinely discussed these mat- ters openly in public . Certainly , public disclosure does not eliminate the privacy of information ; indeed , even information that is exposed to others may retain its private character . Nevertheless , privacy de- pends upon degrees of accessibility of information , and under cer- tain circumstances , even highly sensitive information may not be private . Additionally , focusing on the type of information does not solve the problem of distinguishing between the neighbor \u2019 s telling the po- lice what books he sees a person reading and Amazon.com \u2019 s provid- ing the police with a complete inventory of the books the person has purchased . By attempting to draw a line based upon the type of infor- mation , these two instances would be treated similarly . Another ex- ample more radically illustrates the problem . Many would deem information about a person \u2019 s genitals to be private information . Should the police be required to obtain a warrant before talking to a victim of a sexual assault about an assailant \u2019 s genitals ? This would be absurd . On the other hand , many would express serious objections if the police , without probable cause , could simply compel information from the person \u2019 s doctor . Another way a line could be drawn is based upon people \u2019 s expecta- tions . Such an approach would draw from the Court \u2019 s notion of \u201c rea- sonable expectations of privacy. \u201d The problem with this approach , however , is that an empirical evaluation of expectations alone could gradually lead to the diminishment of privacy as more and more peo- ple come to expect that the records held by third parties can be read- ily obtained by the government.4 If a line can not be drawn based upon the type of information in- volved or people \u2019 s expectations of privacy , then how should the line be drawn ?

The issue is not the conceivable risk of betrayal , but rather which risks people ought to assume and which risks people should be in- sured against . This determination has a normative dimension . When a patient discloses an ailment to a doctor , arguably the patient as- sumes the risk that the doctor will disclose the information to the public . However , there are several protections against this risk . Pa- tient-physician con\ufb01dentiality is protected by ethical rules , which if violated could result in the loss of the doctor \u2019 s license to practice medicine.5 Con\ufb01dentiality is also protected with an evidentiary privi- lege.6 Courts have created tort law causes of action against physicians who disclose personal information.7 Finally , states have passed laws that protect against the disclosure of medical information.8 Thus , in numerous ways , the law structures the patient-physician relationship to protect against the risk of disclosure . Similarly , the law of evidence has recognized the importance of protecting the privacy of commu- nications between attorney and client , priest and penitent , husband and wife , and psychotherapist and patient.9 Our expectations in these relationships are the product of both existing norms and the norm- shaping power of the law . As Christopher Slobogin notes , \u201c in a real sense , we only assume those risks of unregulated government intru- sion that the courts tell us we have to assume. \u201d 10 Therefore , the scope of the architecture should be shaped by con- siderations regarding social relationships . The architecture \u2019 s scope should encompass all instances when third parties share personal in- formation contained within a \u201c system of records. \u201d This term is taken from the Privacy Act , which de\ufb01nes a \u201c system of records \u201d as \u201c a group of any records . . . from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number , symbol , or other iden- tifying particular assigned to the individual. \u201d 11 A \u201c system of records \u201d is used to distinguish between collecting information by speaking with speci\ufb01c individuals versus obtaining it through the vast stores of records held by companies .

The Court \u2019 s conception of privacy assumes that the government stands in the same shoes as everybody else , which is clearly not the case . If we allow a loved one to read our diary , do we also want the government to be able to read it ? As Anthony Amster- dam has observed : \u201c For the tenement dweller , the di\ufb00erence between observation by neighbors and visitors who ordinarily use the com- mon hallways and observation by policemen who come into hallways to \u2018 check up \u2019 or \u2018 look around \u2019 is the di\ufb00erence between all the privacy that his condition allows and none. \u201d 12 Indeed , the existence of Fourth Amendment protection indicates that the government stands in a di\ufb00erent position than ordinary citi- zens or private-sector organizations . The possibility of aggregation and the rise of digital dossiers argue in favor of regulating the govern- ment \u2019 s access to information . The focus should be on the goals of the architecture rather than on technical distinctions over whether information is intimate enough or secret enough . These questions should not derail attention from the important issue of whether government information gathering activities present su\ufb03cient actual and potential dangers to warrant protection . The problems discussed earlier regarding information \ufb02ows from the private sector to the government stem from the exten- siveness of the personal information that businesses are reaping to- day . Focusing on \u201c systems of records \u201d targets the type of information \ufb02ow that raises concern . Because the problem of modern govern- ment information gathering is caused by the increasing dossiers maintained in private-sector record systems , the architecture targets those third parties that store data in record systems . Our relationships with the entities that maintain record systems about us di\ufb00er from other social relationships . Though it is possible for the government to obtain personal data by interviewing friends and others , the information in records is more permanent in nature \u25b2 r e c o n s t r u c t i n g t h e a r c h i t e c t u r e and is readily aggregated .

Relationships to employers and landlords , however , are di\ufb00erent than those with our friends , neighbors , and even strangers . Currently , employers and landlords have a substantial amount of power to ex- tort personal information . They often stand in an unequal position to that of the individual employees or tenants . The nature of the rela- tionship with employers and landlords provides them with a signi\ufb01- cantly greater amount of power and control . If people aren \u2019 t willing to supply the information , then they may not be hired or approved as a tenant . Relationships with merchants and communications providers might not be as directly coercive as those with the entities that govern our livelihoods and dwellings . Because these relationships are more impersonal , should it be left up to the market to decide this issue ? Some might argue that if consumers demanded that companies pro- tect their information from the government , then the market would re\ufb02ect these demands . Thus far , however , the market has not been responsive to this issue . As discussed earlier , privacy policies are often vague about informa- tion \ufb02ows to the government . Individuals are usually unaware of the extent to which information about them is collected . People have di\ufb03culty bargaining over privacy , and the market fails to a\ufb00ord su\ufb03- cient incentives to rectify this problem.13 Further , many companies have never established a relationship with the people whose data they have collected\u2014and thus , there isn \u2019 t even the opportunity to bargain . Even if people are informed , they have little choice but to hand over information to third parties . Life in the Information Age depends upon sharing information with a host of third party companies . The r e c o n s t r u c t i n g t h e a r c h i t e c t u r e \u25b2 Supreme Court in Smith and Miller has suggested that if people want to protect privacy , they should not share their information with third parties .

The market does not seem to o\ufb00er a wide array of choices for people about the amount of privacy they would like to protect .

These mechanisms are embodied in the architecture of the Fifth Amendment.14 The Fifth Amendment pro- vides that \u201c [ n ] o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. \u201d 15 The Fifth Amendment \u2019 s privilege against self-incrimination prevents the government from compelling individ- uals to testify against themselves , and completely bars use of the infor- mation obtained in violation of the right at trial . In contrast , under current Fourth Amendment architecture , evidence is admissible at trial so long as the government obtains it with a valid search warrant . At one point in its history , the Fourth Amendment used to rely heavily on mechanisms of restriction . Early cases , such as Boyd v. United States,16 and Gouled v. United States,17 held that the govern- ment could seize a person \u2019 s private papers only if they were instru- mentalities of a crime\u2014in other words , only if they were actually used to commit"}]}

If they were merely evidence of a crime , how- ever , the government couldn \u2019 t obtain them\u2014even with a warrant . This rule became known as the \u201c mere evidence \u201d rule . The Court later overturned it.18 Perhaps the mere evidence rule should be resurrected and applied to third party records . This would e\ufb00ectively bar the government from obtaining the records . The problem with this solution is that it would cripple modern criminal investigation . As William Stuntz observes : \u201c Government regulation require [ s ] lots of information , and Boyd came dangerously close to giving regulated actors a blanket entitle- ment to nondisclosure . It is hard to see how modern health , safety , environmental , or economic regulation would be possible in such a regime. \u201d 19 Because Boyd rested in part on the Fifth Amendment , it completely prevented the government from obtaining and using the papers against the defendant no matter what procedure the govern- ment had used to obtain them . This approach is far too restrictive when it comes to most personal information maintained in third party records . Mechanisms of Oversight . In the middle of the spectrum are mecha- nisms of oversight . An architecture containing this type of mecha- r e c o n s t r u c t i n g t h e a r c h i t e c t u r e \u25b2 nism is preferable to regulate government access of records held by third parties maintaining \u201c systems of records. \u201d Mechanisms of over- sight allow the government to gather information , but the govern- ment must \ufb01rst justify its need to do so by presenting facts and evidence before a neutral detached judge or magistrate . Oversight is embodied in the Fourth Amendment \u2019 s per se warrant rule . The war- rant requirement achieves the aims of minimization , particulariza- tion , and control . Collection is minimized by the requirement that the government justify that its information gathering is legitimate and necessary . The warrant ensures particularization with its require- ment that there be probable cause that a particular person be en- gaged in criminal activity or that particular place contains evidence of a crime . Finally , the warrant achieves control ( at least over the col- lection e\ufb00orts ) by having a neutral and detached party authorize the collection . In many cases , warrants are the best regulatory device for govern- ment information gathering . Often , at the point during an investiga- tion when certain information from third parties becomes important to obtain , there is already enough evidence to support a warrant . In both Smith and Miller there was probably su\ufb03cient evidence for the police to secure warrants . Therefore , the requirement of a warrant prevents cases of illegitimate abuses\u2014such as large-scale informa- tion sweeps and investigations without particularized suspicion\u2014 without unduly interfering"}]}

Further , third party records have few of the dangers that make warrants ine\ufb03cient . For example , because third parties main- tain the records , there are fewer opportunities for a suspect to hide or destroy documents during the time law enforcement o\ufb03cials obtain a warrant . However , as discussed previously , merely applying the Fourth Amendment to government access to third party records proves inad- equate . The exclusionary rule only provides a remedy at trial , and many of the abuses associated with government information gather- ing extend far beyond criminal trials . Therefore , I recommend a fu- sion between warrants and subpoenas . Despite being far more permissive for government information col- lection purposes , subpoenas have certain protections not available \u25b2 r e c o n s t r u c t i n g t h e a r c h i t e c t u r e with search warrants . Unlike warrants , they can be challenged prior to the seizure of the documents . The subpoenaed party can refuse to comply and make a motion to quash before a judge . Further , subpoe- nas permit the target to produce the documents rather than have government agents rummage through a person \u2019 s home or belong- ings.20 The advantages of subpoenas over search warrants are best il- lustrated in Zurcher v. The Stanford Daily,21 where the police searched a newspaper \u2019 s o\ufb03ces for evidence relating to a criminal suspect . The newspaper was not involved in the alleged crime ; it merely possessed evidence . The Court upheld the search because the police obtained a valid warrant . Dissenting justices contended that there were First Amendment concerns with searches of newspaper o\ufb03ces because they would disrupt journalistic activities and result in \u201c the possibility of disclosure of information received from con\ufb01dential sources , or of the identity of the sources themselves. \u201d 22 Congress responded to Zurcher by passing the Privacy Protection Act of \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf730 , which restricts the use of search warrants for o\ufb03ces of newspapers and other media entities for evidence of crimes of other parties.23 In e\ufb00ect , the Act re- quires the use of subpoenas in addition to warrants to obtain such ev- idence . The bene\ufb01ts of subpoenas , however , often do not apply when they are issued on the third parties to produce an individual \u2019 s records . The third party does not need to notify the individual or may not have any incentive to challenge the subpoena in court . Further , as discussed earlier , subpoenas have many weaknesses compared to warrants , such as a lack of requiring particularized suspicion and little protec- tion by way of oversight by the judiciary . Therefore , the Fourth Amendment architecture should be resur- rected statutorily , by creating a requirement that the government ob- tain a special court order\u2014a fusion between a"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "warrant and a subpoena . From warrants , the standard of probable cause should be used . This threshold would require government o\ufb03cials to go before a judge with speci\ufb01c facts and evidence that a particular person is in- volved in criminal activity . For example , a probable cause standard would prevent government o\ufb03cials from scouring through databases to locate all people who bought books about bomb making or drug manufacturing . Such a search is akin to the types of general searches r e c o n s t r u c t i n g t h e a r c h i t e c t u r e \u25b2 that the Framers wanted to forbid . From subpoenas , advance notice should be provided to the person whose records are involved , and that person should be able to challenge the order in court . This statu- tory regime would incorporate the exclusionary rule , a minimum statutory damages provision , and a framework for disciplining o\ufb00ending law enforcement o\ufb03cials . Moreover , third parties maintaining personal information in a \u201c system of records \u201d should be restricted from voluntarily disclosing an individual \u2019 s personal information to the government except under special circumstances . Exceptions might include allowing disclosure to prevent an imminent threat of harm to another . Another exception would allow the individual to whom the records pertain to authorize the government to obtain them from the third party . For example , if a victim of computer hacking wanted to permit the government to ac- cess the victim \u2019 s own ISP records , the victim could authorize the gov- ernment to do so . Regulating Post-Collection Use of Data Another problem that must be addressed is the way personal infor- mation is used once it has been collected . As Stuntz astutely observes : \u201c Fourth Amendment law regulates the government \u2019 s e\ufb00orts to un- cover information , but it says nothing about what the government may do with the information it uncovers . Yet as the Clinton investiga- tion shows , often the greater privacy intrusion is not the initial disclo- sure but the leaks that follow. \u201d 24 Legal scholar Carol Steiker notes : \u201c Unlike other countries in North America and Western Europe , the United States [ has ] never developed a national plan to organize a \u2018 sys- tem \u2019 of policing or to provide for centralized control over police au- thority. \u201d 25 Once information is collected , the Fourth Amendment \u2019 s architecture of oversight no longer applies . This is problematic , as many of the abuses of information by the government occur after the information has been collected . The Privacy Act of \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf734 provides some limited regulation of records maintained by law enforcement entities . But as discussed earlier in chapter \uf738 , the Act contains many exceptions and loopholes that have limited its e\ufb00ectiveness . Government entities often"}]}

The Privacy Act is an important \ufb01rst step in reining in the vast stores of data that government entities collect . There remains , how- ever , much room for the Privacy Act to be improved and strength- ened . One possible safeguard is to mandate the destruction of data after a certain period of time or , mandate the transfer of data to the judicial branch after a certain period of time for access only under special circumstances . Another way is to adopt a meaningful purpose speci\ufb01cation restriction . This means that , with certain reasonable ex- ceptions , information collected from third party records may only be used for the particular purpose for which it is collected . Developing an Architecture The government \u2019 s increasing access to our digital dossiers is one of the most signi\ufb01cant threats to privacy of our times , and it is inade- quately regulated . The Court \u2019 s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has been mired in the di\ufb03culties of conceptualizing privacy , thus pre- venting the application of the Fourth Amendment . A statutory regime has arisen to \ufb01ll the void , but it is severely \ufb02awed . A new architecture must be constructed , one that e\ufb00ectively regulates the government \u2019 s collection and use of third party records . The process toward develop- ing an appropriate architecture should begin by regulating both the government \u2019 s acquisition of personal data and its downstream uses of it . As for acquiring personal information stored in a system of records , the government should be required to obtain a special court order that combines the bene\ufb01ts of subpoenas and warrants . As for down- stream uses , speci\ufb01c limits must be established for how long the gov- ernment can keep personal information and for what the government can do with it . The task of developing an architecture is not easy in a rapidly changing society that is adjusting to the new dimensions of the Information Age . This proposed solution is thus a beginning of the process . C o n c l u s i o n The problems arising from the emergence of digital dossiers are pro- foundly important . They a\ufb00ect the power of individuals , institutions , and the government ; and they pervade numerous relationships that form the framework of modern society . The way we respond to these problems will signi\ufb01cantly shape the type of society we are construct- ing . Digital dossiers will a\ufb00ect our freedom and power ; they will de\ufb01ne the very texture and tenor of our lives . Ideally , technology empowers us , gives us greater control over our lives ,"}]}

Increasingly , com- panies and the government are using computers to make important decisions about us based on our dossiers , and we are frequently not able to participate in the process . As discussed throughout this book , the law of information privacy has not yet e\ufb00ectively grappled with these problems . Certainly , infor- mation privacy law has had positive e\ufb00ects . It would be far too simple to conclude that the law has failed . But the law has not been su\ufb03- ciently successful , and the problems have grown much more trou- bling during the law \u2019 s watch . \u25b2 224 \u25b2 c o n c l u s i o n One response to these developments is a cynical one . Some com- mentators argue that things have already progressed too far for law to grapple with the problems of digital dossiers . Scott McNealy , CEO of Sun Microsystems , famously quips : \u201c You already have zero pri- vacy . Get over it. \u201d 1 Amitai Etzioni observes that \u201c as long as Americans wish to enjoy the convenience of using credit cards and checks ( as opposed to paying cash ) and of ordering merchandise over the phone and the Internet ( rather than shopping in person ) , they will leave data trails that are di\ufb03cult to erase or conceal. \u201d 2 \u201c To be realistic , \u201d Etzioni states , \u201c the probability of returning the genie to the bottle is nil. \u201d 3 Too often , discussions of privacy parade a horde of horribles , rais- ing fears of new technologies developing too fast for the law to han- dle . We are left with a sense of hopelessness\u2014technology will continue to erode privacy and there is little we can do to stop it . To the contrary , I believe that there is much cause for optimism . We are still in the early days of the Information Age , and we still have the ability to shape the networks of information \ufb02ow . In fact , technology isn \u2019 t the primary culprit\u2014many of the privacy problems I discussed are caused in large part because of the law . The law plays a profound role not just in solving the problems of digital dossiers , but in manufacturing them as well . The law is not merely re- active to new technologies that threaten privacy , but is also a shaping force behind these technologies as well as the amount of privacy we experience today . We often see privacy as naturally occurring and threatened by rapidly developing technology . Law must intervene to protect privacy . However , law creates and constructs the world we live in . This is particularly true with privacy . To a signi\ufb01cant degree , pri- vacy is legally constructed"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ". Law already shapes our ability to hide in- formation and it shapes information accessibility . Law makes certain information publicly available ; it keeps places ( such as the home ) pri- vate by enforcing trespass and property laws . Law also shapes our ex- pectations of privacy in many contexts.4 The law also in\ufb02uences much of the loss of privacy . Many privacy problems are the product of legal decisions that have been made over the past century as we have shaped our modern information econ- omy . Once we understand the full extent of the legal construction of c o n c l u s i o n \u25b2 privacy , we will realize that privacy is not passively slipping away but is being actively eliminated by the way we are constructing the infor- mation economy through the law . In the nineteenth century , Americans faced many signi\ufb01cant pri- vacy problems . For example , since colonial times , the privacy of the mail was a vexing problem . Sealing letters was di\ufb03cult.5 Benjamin Franklin , who was in charge of the colonial mails , required his em- ployees to swear an oath not to open mail.6 Nevertheless , signi\ufb01cant concerns persisted about postal clerks reading people \u2019 s letters . Thomas Je\ufb00erson , Alexander Hamilton , and George Washington fre- quently complained about the lack of privacy in their letters , and they would sometimes write in code.7 As Thomas Je\ufb00erson wrote : \u201c [ T ] he in\ufb01delities of the post o\ufb03ce and the circumstances of the times are against my writing fully and freely. \u201d 8 These problems persisted in the nineteenth century . As Ralph Waldo Emerson declared , it was unlikely that \u201c a bit of paper , contain- ing our most secret thoughts , and protected only by a seal , should travel safely from one end of the world to the other , without anyone whose hands it had passed through having meddled with it. \u201d 9 The law responded to these problems . Congress passed several strict laws protecting the privacy of the mail.10 And in \uf731\uf738\uf737\uf737 , in Ex Parte Jackson , the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment prohibited gov- ernment o\ufb03cials from opening letters without a warrant.11 In the nineteenth century , one might have simply concluded that people shouldn \u2019 t expect privacy in their letters , and that they should \u201c get over it. \u201d But privacy isn \u2019 t just found but constructed . It is the product of a vision for a future society . By erecting a legal structure to protect the privacy of letters , our society shaped the practices of let- ter-writing and using the postal system . It occurred because of the desire to make privacy an integral part of these practices rather than to preserve the status quo . Similar examples abound in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . When the increasing amount of"}]}

Today , we face new technological challenges . Many of the prob- lems we currently encounter are created by the profound growth in the creation and use of digital dossiers . Part of the di\ufb03culty we are experiencing in dealing with these problems is that they are not as easy to capture in a soundbite , and they often do not quickly materi- alize as concrete injuries . When a scandalous secret is disclosed or a hidden video camera is installed in one \u2019 s bedroom , we can easily rec- ognize and describe the privacy harms . The troubles caused by digi- tal dossiers are of a di\ufb00erent sort . These harms are complex and abstract , which is why I invoked the metaphor of Kafka \u2019 s The Trial , since Kafka was so adept at depicting these types of harms . Today , like the all-encompassing Court system that assembled a dossier about Joseph K. , large organizations we know little about are produc- ing digital dossiers about us . The dossiers capture a kind of digital person\u2014a personality translated into digitized form , composed of records , data fragments , and bits of information . Our digital dossiers remain woefully insecure , at risk of being polluted by identity thieves or riddled with careless errors . And all the while , we are like Joseph K.\u2014powerless , uncertain , and uneasy\u2014constantly kept on the out- side while important decisions about us are being made based on our dossiers . I have argued that we need to rethink traditional notions of pri- vacy in order to solve these problems . Protecting privacy in the Infor- mation Age is a question of social design . It is about designing an architecture for the information networks that are increasingly con- stitutive of modern society . The law must restructure our relation- ships with the entities collecting and using our personal information . These relationships are not naturally occurring\u2014it is the law that has de\ufb01ned our relationships to various businesses and institutions , and it is thus the law that is at least partly responsible for our powerless- ness and vulnerability . Changing our relationships with bureaucra- cies can \u2019 t be achieved through isolated lawsuits .

The solu- tion is for the law to place greater controls on its public records by limiting the degree to which personal information in these records can be accessed and used . The increasing government access and use of our digital dossiers is also the product of legal decisions made during the past century . The Supreme Court has interpreted the Fourth Amendment in a short- sighted way , and the use of dossiers threatens a profound end-run around Fourth Amendment protections . The law that \ufb01lls the void fails to adequately control the government \u2019 s tapping into our digital dossiers . The solution is to create a legal structure for keeping govern- ment access to our digital dossiers in check . The government should be required to obtain a special court order when it wants to access personal data that is maintained in a business \u2019 s record systems . All of these solutions are not absolutist ones . I am not advocating that businesses be forbidden from collecting personal data or that public records be made inaccessible or that the government be pro- hibited from obtaining personal information . These absolutist solu- tions are not practical in an information society . In this respect , those that say the genie can \u2019 t be stu\ufb00ed back into the bottle are correct . We will not suddenly turn into Luddites and throw away our credit cards , stop sur\ufb01ng the Internet , and return to using paper records . We are in an Information Age , and there is no turning back . But this does not mean that privacy is destined for extinction . We can have the bene\ufb01ts of an information-driven world without sacri\ufb01cing privacy . The solu- tions I propose do not stop the \ufb02ow of data . Companies can still gather information ; public records can be made widely available ; and the government can obtain personal information . But when compa- nies collect our data , the law should impose weighty responsibilities and should allow people to have greater participation in how the data is used . When public records are made available , the law should do so along with demanding restrictions on access and use . When the gov- ernment wants to obtain personal data , the law should mandate that it demonstrate before a neutral judicial o\ufb03cial that it has a factual \u25b2 c o n c l u s i o n basis that the search will reveal evidence of a particular person \u2019 s crim- inal activity .

LITERATURE REVIEW 5.1 : Forensic Accounting Forensic accounting is a rapidly growing field that combines accounting , auditing , and investigative skills to detect and prevent financial fraud and misconduct . Forensic accounting has a long history dating back to ancient times when accounting records were used in legal disputes . However , modern forensic accounting practice began to develop in the 20th century , with the growth of organized crime and the need for financial investigations ( Bologna & Lindquist , 1995 ) . In the 1970s , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( S.E.C . ) created the Division of Enforcement , which included forensic accountants as part of its investigative team ( Albrecht et al. , 2018 ) . Forensic accounting uses various techniques to gather and analyze financial information . These techniques include financial statement analysis , fraud detection and prevention , investigative accounting , and data analysis ( Silverstone et al. , 2012 ) . Forensic accountants also use specialized software and tools to analyze financial data and identify potential fraud ( Jimmy , 2018 ) . Forensic accounting has many applications , including criminal and civil investigations , bankruptcy and insolvency cases , divorce proceedings , and insurance claims ( Singleton et al. , 2006 ) . Forensic accountants also play an essential role in regulatory compliance , helping businesses and organizations meet legal and ethical standards ( Hiles , 2012 ) . Forensic accounting has become increasingly important in today 's society , where financial fraud and corruption are prevalent . Forensic accountants play a vital role in identifying and investigating financial crimes , providing evidence for use in court proceedings , and helping to prevent future fraud ( Wells , 2005 ) . They also manage risk , helping businesses and organizations identify and mitigate financial risks . Forensic accounting is an essential tool in the fight against financial crimes . Its history , techniques , applications , and importance demonstrate the value of this field in identifying and preventing fraudulent and illegal financial activities . As financial crimes continue to grow in"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "complexity , the role of forensic accountants will become even more vital in protecting businesses , organizations , and individuals from financial harm . Forensic accountants are well- positioned to provide expert opinions in legal proceedings , perform fraud risk assessments , and design adequate internal controls to prevent fraudulent activities ( Albrecht et al. , 2018 ) . The unique challenges forensic accountants face in detecting and preventing fraud are the complexity of billing and reimbursement systems and the need for specialized knowledge and laws . In addition , forensic accountants should know psychological and behavioral characteristics to better understand financial fraud 's motivations and develop effective prevention and detection strategies ( Clarkson and Darjee , 2022 ) . Data analytics , artificial intelligence , and blockchain technology are increasingly important in detecting and preventing financial fraud ( Newman et al. , 2021 ) . Forensic accountants considered data analytics and internal controls the most effective methods for detecting financial fraud , while external audits were less effective ( Albrecht et al. , 2018 ) . Forensic accounting highlights the growing importance of detecting and preventing financial fraud . With the increasing use of technology and the complex nature of financial crimes , forensic accountants play a critical role in providing expert opinions , designing adequate internal controls , and using data analytics to detect and prevent fraud . 5.2 : Financial Fraud Financial fraud is a severe and pervasive issue that can have significant negative impacts on individuals , organizations , and even entire economies . Financial fraud can take many forms , including accounting , securities , money laundering , and Ponzi schemes ( Wolfe & Hermanson , 2004 ) . Accounting fraud involves intentionally misrepresenting financial information to deceive stakeholders . Securities fraud involves the manipulation of financial markets to generate illegal profits . Money laundering involves concealing the origin of illegally obtained money . Ponzi schemes involve paying returns to investors from new investors ' capital rather than from actual profits ( \u00dcnvan , 2020 ) . Financial fraud can significantly impact individuals , businesses , and governments . It can result in financial losses , bankruptcy , and reputational damage . Fraudulent activities can also erode public trust in institutions and undermine the integrity of economic systems ( Ren et al. , 2021 ) . Preventing and detecting financial fraud requires various measures , including internal controls , auditing , and regulatory oversight . Internal controls can include policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraudulent organizational activities ( Donelson et al. , 2017 ) . Auditing involves reviewing financial records and processes to identify any irregularities . Regulatory oversight involves government agencies monitoring and enforcing compliance with financial regulations ( Occhino , 2017 ) . Financial fraud is a pervasive problem requiring organizations to implement strong internal controls , conduct regular risk assessments , and provide training for employee fraud . The role of forensic accountants in detecting and preventing financial fraud is"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "critical , but they face various challenges , such as keeping up with emerging technologies and evolving fraud internal control schemes . Therefore , organizations should prioritize risk management , improvements , and collaboration with law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies to mitigate fraud risks effectively . Additionally , integrating technology with human expertise can enhance fraud detection and prevention efforts , but ethical and legal technology-related concerns should also be addressed . 5.3 : Data Analytics Data analytics is extracting insights and information from data using various analytical and statistical tools . With the growth of big data , data analytics has become a critical component of decision-making processes for businesses , organizations , and governments . For example , data analytics has become an essential component of forensic accounting in recent years , with the growing availability of vast amounts of data and advancements in data analytics technologies . Data analytics can be categorized into three main types : descriptive analytics , predictive analytics , and prescriptive analytics ( Davenport , 2006 ) . Descriptive analytics involves analyzing historical data to identify patterns and trends . Predictive analytics involves using statistical algorithms to analyze data and predict future events . Prescriptive analytics involves optimizing algorithms to determine the best action to achieve a specific outcome . Data analytics has significantly impacted businesses , organizations , and governments . It has allowed more informed decision-making , increased efficiency , and improved customer experiences . For example , data analytics has improved supply chain management , optimized marketing campaigns , and reduced operational costs ( Chen & Zhang , 2014 ) . Data analytics has also been used in healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs ( Galetsi et al. , 2019 ) . Despite the benefits of data analytics , implementing it has several challenges . One of the main challenges is data quality . Poor data quality can result in inaccurate insights and decisions ( Mashoufi et al. , 2023 ) . Another challenge is data privacy and security . With the increasing amount of personal and sensitive data being collected , there is a growing concern about how this data is used and protected ( Sivarajah et al. , 2017 ) . Additionally , there is a shortage of skilled data analysts and data scientists , which can limit the effectiveness of data analytics ( Mashoufi et al. , 2023 ) . Data analytics is a rapidly evolving field that provides numerous benefits to organizations , including improved decision-making , increased operational efficiency , and competitive advantage . Despite the challenges associated with its implementation , data analytics will likely continue to be a crucial tool for organizations to extract insights from vast amounts of data and gain a competitive edge . Organizations must adapt and leverage emerging technologies and trends as data analytics evolves to stay ahead of the curve . 5.4 : Cyber Forensic Accounting With the increasing prevalence of cybercrime , the need"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "for cyber forensic accounting has become increasingly important . Cyber forensic accounting is the application of forensic accounting principles to investigate and prevent cybercrimes . Cyber forensic accounting is critical in analyzing cybercrimes and identifying the perpetrators . It involves using various techniques such as data analytics , digital forensics , and financial investigations to identify cyber- attack sources and recover stolen assets ( Law , 2011 ) . Cyber forensic accounting is also crucial in preventing future cyber-attacks by identifying weaknesses in the organization 's cyber security measures and implementing appropriate controls ( Moid , 2018 ) . Cybercrimes can take many forms , including hacking , identity theft , cyberstalking , and phishing . Hacking involves gaining unauthorized access to a computer system , while identity theft involves stealing personal information to impersonate someone else . Cyberstalking consists of the use of electronic communication to harass or threaten someone , while phishing involves the use of fake emails or websites to steal personal information ( Tonellotto , 2020 ) . Investigating cybercrimes can be challenging due to several factors . One of the main challenges is the constantly evolving nature of cyber-attacks , which makes it difficult to stay ahead of cybercriminals ( Law , 2011 ) . Another challenge is identifying the perpetrators of cybercrimes , who often operate anonymously from remote locations ( Cavusoglu , 2004 ) . Additionally , the vast amount of data involved in cybercrimes can make it challenging to extract relevant information and identify patterns ( McGuire & Dowling , 2013 ) . Therefore , cyber forensic accounting is critical in investigating and preventing cybercrimes . 5.5 : Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies are a digital currency that operates independently of a central bank . Cryptocurrencies have grown significantly in recent years and have become a popular form of investment and payment . The first cryptocurrency , Bitcoin , was introduced in 2009 by an unknown individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto ( Nakamoto , 2008 ) . Since then , numerous other cryptocurrencies , such as Ethereum and Litecoin , have been developed . Cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology , which allows for secure , decentralized transactions . The use of cryptocurrencies has had a significant impact on the financial industry . Cryptocurrencies offer several advantages over traditional forms of currency , such as lower transaction fees , faster transactions , and increased security ( Sovbetov , 2018 ) . Cryptocurrencies have also facilitated international transactions and provided financial services to individuals who lack access to traditional banking systems . Despite their benefits , cryptocurrencies also pose several challenges and risks . One of the main challenges is their volatility , as their value can fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably ( Gandal et al. , 2018 ) . Cryptocurrencies are also vulnerable to hacking and fraud , as cryptocurrency exchanges have been hacked , losing millions of dollars ( Kshetri , 2018 ) . Additionally , cryptocurrencies have been associated with illegal"}]}

It has become a popular tool for various industries , including finance , healthcare , and supply chain management . The first blockchain technology was introduced in 2008 by an individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto to create a decentralized digital currency , Bitcoin ( Nakamoto , 2008 ) . Since then , blockchain technology has been developed and implemented in various industries , including finance , healthcare , and supply chain management . As a result , blockchain technology has significantly impacted multiple industries . For example , the finance industry has facilitated secure , transparent , fast transactions , potentially reducing costs and increasing efficiency ( Swan , 2015 ) . In healthcare , blockchain technology has improved patient data security and privacy ( Ekblaw et al. , 2016 ) . In supply chain management , it has enabled greater transparency and traceability , facilitating the tracking of products from production to consumption ( Crosby et al. , 2016 ) . Despite its benefits , blockchain technology also poses several challenges and risks . One of the main challenges is scalability , as the current blockchain systems have limited processing capacity and can become congested during periods of high usage ( Sompolinsky , 2016 ) . Another challenge is the lack of regulation and standardization , which can lead to inconsistency and confusion in the application of blockchain technology ( B\u00f6hme et al. , 2015 ) . Additionally , blockchain technology is not immune to cyber-attacks and hacking attempts , as evidenced by several high-profile incidents in recent years ( Kshetri , 2018 ) . 5.7 : Emerging Trends in Forensic Accounting : Implications for Fraud Prevention and Investigation The rise in financial accounting fraud is attributed to the prevailing economic conditions , leading to the emergence of fraud analysis as a crucial subject in academic , research , and industrial circles . As organizations ' internal audit systems fail to identify accounting fraud , techniques , such as forensic accounting , have been developed to uncover fraud ( Okoye & Gbegi , 2013 ) . The emerging trends in forensic accounting , including data analytics , cyber forensic accounting , and forensic accounting in the era of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology , have significant implications for fraud investigation and prevention . Data analytics has become an increasingly popular tool in forensic accounting to identify potential fraudulent activities through the analysis of financial data . Data analytics tools can detect data manipulation and fraudulent financial statements more quickly and accurately than traditional methods ( Bhattarai et al. , ( 2019 ) . It highlights the need for forensic accountants to develop data analysis and mining skills to keep up with the evolving nature of fraud"}]}

Cyber forensic accounting is a new field that investigates cybercrime through digital forensics , network analysis , and data mining . Cybercrime has become increasingly common , with data breaches being a frequent occurrence . Cyber forensic accountants play a critical role in identifying the source of the breach , assessing its impact , and identifying the stolen data . In addition , it highlights the need for forensic accountants to be proficient in cybersecurity and traditional accounting skills . Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have presented novel challenges and opportunities for forensic accountants ( Deepa et al. , 2022 ) . For example , blockchain is a decentralized and transparent ledger that records all transactions , making it easier for forensic accountants to trace and analyze transactions and detect suspicious activities involving cryptocurrencies ( Sharma et al. , 2023 ) . Additionally , blockchain technology can aid forensic accountants in establishing the existence , ownership , and transfer of assets , which is critical in fraud investigations ( Garanina et ai. , 2022 ) .

EMERGING TRENDS IN FORENSIC ACCOUNTING 6.1 : Trend 1 : Use of Data Analytics in Forensic Accounting Data analytics techniques in forensic accounting have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to enhance fraud detection and prevention efforts . According to Rezaee & Wang ( 2019 ) , data analytics techniques are increasingly utilized in forensic accounting for fraud detection and prevention . This section of the research paper will provide an in-depth analysis of the application of data analytics techniques in forensic accounting for fraud detection and prevention . 6.1.1 : Data Mining Techniques Data mining techniques have been widely used in forensic accounting to detect and prevent fraud . Clustering , classification , and association rule mining are the most commonly used data mining techniques in forensic accounting ( Liu et al. , 2022 ) . Clustering is a technique that involves grouping similar data points based on their characteristics . For example , in forensic accounting , clustering can identify groups of transactions that share similar features , such as the same vendor , invoice number , or date . Classification is a technique that involves assigning a label to a data point based on its characteristics . For example , in forensic accounting , classification can label transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on their features , such as the amount , type of transaction , or vendor . Finally , association rule mining is a technique that involves identifying relationships between different variables in a dataset . For example , in forensic accounting , association rule mining can be used to identify patterns of behavior associated with fraudulent activities , such as transactions involving round numbers or multiple payments to the same vendor . Data visualization techniques can also be used in data mining to identify patterns , trends , and anomalies in financial and non-financial data . For example , visualization tools such as scatter plots , bar charts , and heat maps can represent complex data visually , making it easier to identify trends and anomalies ( Fawcett & Provost , 1997 ) . In summary , data mining techniques such as clustering , classification , association rule mining , and data visualization are powerful tools for detecting and preventing fraud in forensic accounting . 6.1.2 : Machine Learning Techniques : Machine learning techniques are increasingly being used in forensic accounting to develop more effective fraud detection and prevention models . This section will explore applying these techniques in forensic accounting , including supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms , such as decision trees , logistic regression , support vector machines , and clustering algorithms ( Liu et al. , 2022 ) . Supervised machine learning algorithms involve training a model on labeled data to predict outcomes for new"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ", unlabeled data . These algorithms can be used in forensic accounting to develop predictive models that identify fraudulent transactions based on historical data and real- time monitoring of transactions and activities . For instance , decision trees can identify essential variables that predict fraud , while logistic regression can help estimate the probability of a fraudulent transaction based on its characteristics ( Cai et al. , 2019 ) . Unsupervised machine learning algorithms involve finding patterns and relationships in unlabeled data without specific guidance from labeled data . For example , clustering algorithms can identify groups of transactions that share similar features , such as the same vendor or invoice number . This can help investigators identify suspicious transactions that might be indicative of fraud . Overall , machine learning techniques have the potential to improve fraud detection and prevention in forensic accounting significantly . By utilizing these techniques , investigators can develop predictive models that can identify suspicious transactions in real-time and prevent fraudulent activities before they occur . 6.1.3 : Predictive Modeling Techniques Predictive modeling techniques have become increasingly crucial in forensic accounting to detect and prevent fraudulent activities . This section will explore various predictive modeling techniques , such as time series analysis , regression analysis , and Bayesian networks ( Kuhn & Johnson , 2013 ) , to analyze financial and non-financial data to identify patterns , trends , and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activities . Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze data points collected over time . For example , it can be applied in forensic accounting to detect irregularities or unusual patterns in financial data over time ( Liu et al. , 2022 ) . Regression analysis , on the other hand , is a statistical method that analyzes the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables . It can be used to develop models to predict fraudulent activities based on historical data ( Cai et al. , 2019 ) Bayesian networks are another powerful predictive modeling tool used in forensic accounting to identify and analyze complex relationships between variables . These networks can help identify potential risk factors and provide insights into the underlying causes of fraudulent activities ( Soltani et al. , 2023 ) . In addition to identifying potential fraud , predictive modeling can be used in risk assessment and prediction ( Sanad & Al-Sartawi , 2021 ) . However , developing and validating predictive models can be challenging , and it requires careful consideration of the data , the selection of appropriate variables , and using proper techniques ( Cai et al. , 2019 ) . However , carefully considering the data and selecting variables is essential to develop accurate models . 6.1.4 : Real-world Examples of Data Analytics ' Effectiveness in Fraud Investigation and Prevention Real-world examples and case studies can serve as practical illustrations of the effectiveness of data analytics in fraud investigation and prevention .

Blockchain technology provides a decentralized , immutable , and transparent ledger that records all transactions in a distributed network of computers ( Crosby et al. , 2016 ) . Each transaction on the blockchain is linked to the previous one through cryptographic hashes , creating an unbroken chain of transactions , which enables traceability ( Swan , 2015 ) . Blockchain technology uses consensus algorithms to validate transactions and ensure network participants approve them , creating a system of accountability ( Nakamoto , 2008 ) . Smart contracts can automatically enforce predefined rules and conditions , eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of fraud or mismanagement ( Buterin , 2014 ) . The transparency and traceability of blockchain transactions can facilitate efficient and effective auditing processes , as auditors can directly access and verify transaction data ( B\u00f6hme et al. , 2015 ) . The immutability and transparency of blockchain transactions can also deter fraudsters , as fraudulent activities would be more easily traceable and detectable on the blockchain ( Kshetri , 2018 ) . However , it 's important to note that blockchain technology is not a panacea and has limitations . For example , it may not be able to detect frauds outside the blockchain or involve social engineering . It may also raise privacy concerns as it records all transactions in a transparent ledger . Therefore , forensic accountants need to carefully consider these limitations and potential ethical implications when using blockchain technology in their investigations ( Zhang , 2020 ) . Blockchain technology can enhance transparency , traceability , and accountability in financial transactions . Therefore , it can be a valuable tool in forensic accounting for fraud detection , Prevention , and auditing . However , it is essential to understand its limitations and ethical considerations when incorporating blockchain technology into forensic accounting practices . Therefore , further research and exploration of blockchain technology 's potential applications and implications in forensic accounting are warranted . 6.3.3 : Real-world Examples of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology for Fraud Investigation and Prevention Real-world examples and case studies can provide practical insights into the implications of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology for fraud investigation and Prevention in forensic accounting . Here are a few examples : 6.3.3.1 : Silk Road Case : Silk Road was an online black market that operated on the dark web and facilitated the sale of illegal drugs , counterfeit currencies , and other illegal goods and services using Bitcoin as the primary form of payment . In 2013 ,"}]}

In addition , the case highlighted the challenges of investigating fraud involving cryptocurrencies , such as the lack of regulations , the pseudonymous nature of transactions , and the need for sophisticated blockchain analysis techniques to uncover fraudulent activities . 6.3.3.3 : OneCoin Case : OneCoin was a cryptocurrency-based Ponzi scheme that operated from 2014 to 2017 , defrauding investors of billions of dollars . The investigation into the OneCoin case involved analyzing the blockchain and other digital evidence to uncover fraudulent activities and track the flow of funds . In addition , the case demonstrated how blockchain technology could be used in forensic accounting to detect and prevent frauds involving cryptocurrencies and the need for regulatory oversight in cryptocurrency . 6.3.3.4 : Anti-Money Laundering ( A.M.L . ) Compliance : Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have implications for anti-money laundering ( A.M.L . ) compliance in forensic accounting . For example , many countries have implemented regulations that require cryptocurrency exchanges and other virtual asset service providers to comply with A.M.L . regulations , including Know Your Customer ( KYC ) and transaction monitoring requirements . As a result , forensic accountants can use blockchain analysis techniques to verify compliance with A.M.L . regulations , identify potential money laundering activities , and trace the flow of funds in suspicious transactions . 6.3.3.5 : Auditing and Compliance : Blockchain technology can potentially streamline auditing and compliance efforts in forensic accounting . For example , some companies have started using blockchain for supply chain management , where transactions related to the movement of goods and services are recorded on the blockchain . As a result , forensic accountants can use blockchain analysis techniques to verify the accuracy and integrity of supply chain transactions , ensuring compliance with auditing and regulatory requirements .

Eloundou et al . ( 2023 ) estimate that generative AI can perform tasks associated with over 80 % of U.S. jobs and that AI task coverage is notably higher for occupations that require advanced degrees . The ability of generative AI to perform tasks required in such high-skilled occupations \u2014 allowing it to assist doctors in diagnosing diseases , lawyers in drafting legal documents , and software engineers with code development \u2014 has led to predictions of substantial productivity gains from the adoption of such technologies ( Baily , Brynjolfsson , and Korinek 2023 ) . Others , however , are less optimistic about such productivity gains ( Acemoglu 2024 ) . Uncertainty around firms \u2019 willingness to adopt these technologies and their capacity to make necessary complementary investments ( Bresnahan 2024 ; Brynjolfsson , Rock , and Syverson 2021 ) makes it currently difficult to empirically assess whether or not optimism about productivity gains is"}]}

An example is software development , where commercial coding assistants based on generative AI have gained widespread adoption.2 In this project , we ask how generative AI affects the productivity of knowledge work- ers , using software developers as an example . We analyze three large-scale randomized controlled trials in a real-world environment . These experiments randomly assigned access to Copilot , a coding assistant developed by GitHub in collaboration with Ope- nAI , to just under five thousand software developers at Microsoft , Accenture , and an anonymous Fortune 100 electronics manufacturing company ( henceforth Anonymous Company ) . These experiments were run as part of the ordinary course of business at these companies to decide whether or how extensively to adopt these technologies , and the companies kindly shared the resulting data with us.3 These experiments lasted 2 to 8 months after which all groups were granted access to Copilot . Our preferred estimates from an instrumental variable regression suggest that usage of the coding assistant causes a 26.08 % ( SE : 10.3 % ) increase in the weekly number of completed tasks for those using the tool.4 When we look at outcomes of secondary in- terest , our results support this interpretation , with a 13.55 % ( SE : 10.0 % ) increase in the number of code updates ( commits ) and a 38.38 % ( SE : 12.55 % ) increase in the number of times code was compiled . For Microsoft we observe both the developers \u2019 tenure and 1In addition , it is hard to predict further breakthroughs in the architecture of these models , which may lead to further improvements in quality or decrease the cost of inference and training . 2Prior academic work has shown that generative AI can pass mock interviews for coding jobs at Amazon in the top decile of human performance , performs at human level in a database of coding challenges that measure programming logic and proficiency , and can write entire programs for simple video games from several lines of instructions ( Bubeck et al . 2023 ) . Copilot is used by 1.3 million subscribers and more than 50,000 businesses . 3The exact implementation of these experiments was rather ad-hoc as they were driven by business considerations at these companies rather than research goals . 4Because of imperfect compliance , our preferred estimates use treatment status as an instrument for usage , so this is an estimate of the treatment on the treated . their seniority as measured by job title . We find that Copilot significantly raises task completion for more recent hires and those in more junior positions but not for develop- ers with longer tenure and in more senior positions . An important question is whether AI will be more beneficial to low-productivity or high-productivity workers . Prior work has shown that"}]}

Like the first set of papers , we find that generative AI increases the productivity of lower-ability workers more , even when workers are performing tasks according to their tenure or seniority . Our preferred estimate pools estimates across all three experiments and places more weight on periods with larger differences in treatment status . We make these choices because our analysis must confront challenges related to statistical power despite the large number of software developers in the experiments . These challenges arise due to large variation in measured outcomes and factors that reduce the take-up and duration of the three experiments.5 The experiment at Microsoft started before Copilot was widely known ( and before the release of ChatGPT ) , and initial uptake was low . Shortly after a larger fraction of developers in the treatment group started using it , the control group was also allowed access . At Accenture , only a few hundred developers participated in the experiment . Lastly , at Anonymous Company , the treatment consisted of a staggered rollout with differences in treatment status lasting only a short time . Most studies of the impact of generative AI tools on worker productivity have been conducted in controlled lab-like experiments ( Campero et al . 2022 ; Noy and Zhang 2023 ; Peng et al . 2023 ; Vaithilingam , Zhang , and Glassman 2022 ) . In a lab-in-the-field exper- iment on consultants employed by Boston Consulting Group , Dell \u2019 Acqua et al . ( 2023 ) find that productivity on 18 tasks designed to mimic the day-to-day work at a consulting company increased by 12 % -25 % . Evidence from these experiments generally suggests significant productivity effects of generative AI . The exception is Vaithilingam , Zhang , and Glassman ( 2022 ) , which did not find a statistically significant difference in comple- tion time . While lab experiments offer a valuable opportunity to examine the short-term impli- cations of generative AI , challenges and complex interactions arise when these tools are deployed in real-world environments ( Jaffe et al . 2024 ) . There are some observational studies of the effects of generative AI in an actual workplace setting ( Hoffmann et al . 2024 ; Yeverechyahu , Mayya , and Oestreicher-Singer 2024 ) .

We fill this gap in the literature by examining a field experiment with high-skilled and highly paid knowledge workers , a group that is particularly relevant given the prediction that high-skilled jobs will be most affected by this technology . Although we examine a different part of the skill distribution and use experimental variation rather than a staggered introduction , we find similar pro- ductivity increases as Brynjolfsson , Li , and Raymond ( 2023 ) . Furthermore , like them , we also find suggestive evidence that these gains are primarily driven by improved output from recent hires and employees in more junior roles . More generally , we contribute to the literature studying the productivity and on-the- job performance of software developers ( Cowgill et al . 2020 ; Emanuel , Harrington , and Pallais 2023 ; Murciano-Goroff 2022 ) . 2 Setting and Experiments 2.1 What Is AI-Assisted Software Development ? AI Assistants for software development offer intelligent code suggestions and auto- completion within integrated development environments . Prominent examples include GitHub Copilot , Cursor , and Replit Ghostwriter . In our study , we examine the effects of one of these tools , GitHub Copilot . GitHub Copilot was developed by GitHub in part- nership with OpenAI . It was available for `` technical preview '' in June 2021 and publicly available in June 2022 , just a few months before the first of the experiments we analyze.6 The development of Copilot involved combining advanced machine learning techniques and natural language processing . A substantial amount of code from public GitHub repositories was used to train Copilot . This extensive dataset allowed the AI model to learn from real-world coding practices , patterns , and styles across various programming languages and frameworks . See Nagle et al . ( 2023 ) for an in-depth overview of the origins and evolution of GitHub Copilot . Copilot integrates with the software that developers use for coding . As developers write software code or plain text comments , Copilot analyzes the context and generates relevant code snippets , comments , and documentation . It can autocomplete code that developers might manually type or suggest snippets they would otherwise need to search for online . This capability can save developers time and potentially improve code quality by offering suggestions the developer might not be aware of . However , like all tools based on Large Language Models"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "( LLMs ) , Copilot can make mistakes . If developers rely on it without review , it could potentially introduce errors or decrease code quality . While general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT can also help with software development , they are less specialized and don \u2019 t integrate with standard coding tools . 6ChatGPT , the first general-purpose public tool of this class of AI models was released on November 30 , 2022 . 2.2 Experiments We analyze three randomized experiments conducted with software developers at Mi- crosoft , Accenture , and Anonymous Company . In the Microsoft and Accenture experi- ments , one group of developers ( the treated group ) was randomly assigned to be able to access GitHub Copilot , whereas the other group ( the control group ) did not have access to the tool for a period of eight ( Microsoft ) or four ( Accenture ) months . In the Anony- mous Company experiment , all users gained access to the tool over a period of two months , but access dates were randomized , with some teams gaining access six weeks before others . Microsoft The experiment at Microsoft started in the first week of September 2022 , in- volving a sample size of 1,746 developers primarily located in the United States . Of these developers , 50.4 % were randomly selected to receive access to Github Copilot . Random- ization was implemented at both the individual and the team levels.7 In particular , 616 developers were individually randomized and 1,130 developers were randomized at the team level , with an average team size of 6.2 . The developers work on building a wide range of software within Microsoft , with tasks that include engineering , designing , and testing software products and services . They occupy various positions in the company , ranging from entry-level developers to team managers . They may work in a team or individually , depending on their task and team structure . Participants in the treated group were informed via email about the opportunity to sign up for GitHub Copilot . The email also included information introducing GitHub Copilot as a productivity-enhancing tool and outlining its potential impact on their cod- ing tasks ( see Figure 9 in Appendix ) . Beyond this email , treated participants did not receive any specific instructions regarding their workload or workflow to ensure they use GitHub Copilot in their natural work environment . Control group participants did not receive any communication as part of the study , even when they were eventually allowed access.8 The experiment ended on May 3rd , 2023 , as growing awareness of AI-assisted coding tools led the control group participants to seek access to Copilot . Accenture The Accenture experiment started in the last week of July 2023 and included a number of Accenture offices located in Southeast Asia .

Our setting has the advantage that almost all professional software development follows a highly structured workflow , where specific tasks are defined and tracked through version control software . This makes internally defined goals quantifiable . All three participating organizations use the version control software GitHub . By observing the developers \u2019 GitHub activity , we can observe many of the variables that are part of their workflow . A main outcome of interest is \u201c pull requests \u201d , which can be thought of as a unit of work for software developers . Within an organization , the scope of a pull request is likely to remain relatively stable over time , shaped by organizational norms and conventions , even though different organizations may define this scope differently . For instance , a pull request may be asking for a feature to be added to a larger software project . A pull request will lead to a code review , often by a more senior software developer . If this review is passed , the code will be merged and thereby become part of the larger software project . We use three additional outcome variables related to the developers \u2019 workflow . Before submitting a pull request , a developer will work separately on her code , tracking smaller changes through \u201c commits. \u201d Periodically , the developer will \u201c build \u201d the code they are working on , and we can observe whether it compiled successfully . While commits and builds do not directly correspond to a deliverable , we expect them to be nevertheless monotone in the amount of accomplished work . Lastly , we use the build success rate as a measure of code quality . In addition to these output measures , we observe how developers use Copilot . For each developer who uses Copilot , we observe both the"}]}

This approach captures the initial willingness to try and use the technology . Figure 2 presents the cumulative adoption rates for the three experiments . In Panel ( a ) , we observe that during the first two weeks of the Microsoft experiment , only 8.5 percent of the treated group signed up for GitHub Copilot . This low adoption rate might have been due to inattentiveness to the initial email notification . Consequently , Microsoft sent two additional email reminders on Feb 15th , 2023 , and Feb 28th , 2023 . These additional emails increased the take-up rate to 42.5 % within two weeks of being sent .

At the conclusion of the experiment in April 2023 , the control group was given access to Copilot , and we observed a rapid adoption rate in the control group . However , in Jan 2024 , adoption in the control group ( 64.0 % ) remained below the adoption in the treated group ( 75.6 % ) , providing limited long-run variation in adoption generated by the emails encouraging adoption sent as part of the experiment ( which were only ever sent to the treatment group . ) Panel ( b ) reports the adoption rate of Copilot in the Accenture experiment .

As evident from the plot , all developers gained access to Copilot after six weeks . During the invi- tation rollout in September and October , we observed a steady increase in adoption as developers got access to Copilot . Following the initial increase in adoption , the adoption rate plateaued , showing only small , steady increases for the remainder of the experiment . It is worth noting that adopting Copilot is relatively easier and less costly compared to other AI tools in the workplace . It does not require any complementary investment , can be adopted individually , and integrates directly into the existing development environ- ment . Despite this , the adoption rate is significantly below 100 % in all three experiments , with around 30-40 % of the engineers not even trying the product . Moreover , we observe that the adoption rates are remarkably similar across the experiments . This suggests that factors other than access , such as individual preferences and perceived quality of the tool , play important roles in engineers \u2019 decisions to use this tool ( Dietvorst , Simmons , and Massey 2015 , 2018 ) . 010203040Percent ( % ) 024601020304050Percent ( % ) 0123010203040Percent ( % ) 01234 ( a ) Microsoft Experiment ( b ) Accenture Experiment ( c ) Anonymous Company Experiment Figure 2 : Cumulative Adoption Rates Notes : The first two graphs show the cumulative rate of adoption over time for software devel- opers in both the treatment and control groups across various experiments .

Hence , we show the cumulative fraction of users invited to participate and who adopted Copilot . 4 Empirical Strategy & Main Results 4.1 Empirical Strategy Our empirical strategy exploits the experimental variation while accommodating imper- fect compliance by utilizing the experimental assignment as an instrument for the adop- tion of GitHub Copilot . For each experiment , we observe data at the developer-week level . To gain precision , we control for both developer and week-fixed effects ( to account for , e.g. , differences in developer skills and holidays ) . This leaves us with the following regression as our main specification : yit = \u03b2Dit + \u00b5i + \u03b3t + \u03f5it .

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2SLS ) , instrumenting Dit with a dummy Zit that turns on for all developers randomized into the treatment group after the start of the experiment . Before we move on to the results , we have to discuss a key complication : our data comes from experiments where the control group was eventually also allowed to access GitHub Copilot . This is not a challenge for identification , but it reduces the power of our instrument if we employ the naive strategy detailed above . In particular , consider a hypothetical experiment that lasts just one month : at t = 0 , developers are randomized into treatment and control groups , where control is not allowed access to Copilot until t = 4 . Suppose further that , starting at t = 4 , the differences in uptake between the two groups start declining over time , asymptoting a zero uptake difference . If we naively estimate ( 1 ) by 2SLS in this setting , the power of our instrument ( and hence the precision of our estimates ) will be strictly declining in the number of periods we observe \u2013 in the limit , with infinite periods , our instrument violates the relevance condition because initial treatment assignment eventually fails to predict uptake . One potential solution to this dilemma involves cutting out some data and using only t \u2208 { 1 , . . . , 4 } to estimate the model . During this period , the instrument has maximal relevance . However , to the extent that there is still an adoption difference between treatment and control groups at t = 5 , this strategy is wasteful in that it does not exploit all possible identifying variations . To avoid ad-hoc decisions about how many periods after the experiment ends should be included in the analyzed data , we weight the 2SLS estimates by the ( period-by-period ) difference in adoption across treatment and control groups . The resulting weighted IV regression gracefully handles the issue of declining instrument relevance , and it has been previously proposed and analyzed in the context of uptake differences across individ- uals by ( Coussens and Spiess 2021 ; Huntington-Klein 2020 ) ; in the context of uptake differences over time , a similar strategy was employed by Bloom et al . ( 2012 ) to improve precision . The impact of our weighting on the interpretation of our results is straightforward : the weighted regression weights periods based on the difference in Copilot adoption between control and treatment groups . As we can see in Appendix Figure 8 , the weighted IV estimates place greater emphasis on treatment effects during periods like March 2023 in the Microsoft experiment , where there was a significant difference in adoption between the treatment and control groups . Thus , to the extent that one would expect treatment effects that are heterogeneous over calendar time ( e.g. , because Copilot"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "improved over time ) , the weighting will affect which estimand our estimator is targeting . If , on the other hand , treatment effects are unchanged over the course of the experiment , the weighting will purely improve the precision of our estimates without affecting their interpretation . 9For the initial phase of the Microsoft experiment , we do not observe intensive usage data . Hence , we say a developer at Microsoft has adopted Copilot after they either register to use it ( relevant in the initial phase ) or we see any usage of Copilot ( relevant in the later phase . ) 4.2 Results We present our results in Table 2 , split by experiment . We divide each coefficient by the mean in the control group for that variable and multiply by 100 so that coefficients in this table can be interpreted as percentage effects.10 To enable easy comparison to observational studies such as Brynjolfsson , Li , and Raymond ( 2023 ) , we present both difference-in-difference ( DiD ) estimates that do not exploit experimental variation and our main ( weighted ) results ( W-IV ) , which do.11 Interestingly , we find that our difference- in-difference estimates are sometimes larger and sometimes smaller than the experimen- tal estimates , emphasizing that the reasons for the divergence between experimental and observational estimates may differ across companies . At Microsoft , we find positive effects of Copilot on the number of completed pull re- quests , the number of commits made , and the number of times that code was built ( i.e. , compiled . ) Focusing on the more credible experimental estimates , however , only the ef- fect on the number of pull requests is statistically significant at conventional significance levels . We find no negative effect on the build success rate , which would be negatively affected if Copilot was writing code that does not compile and these mistakes are not caught by developers . Although not always statistically significant , we find directionally similar effect sizes at Accenture and Anonymous Company , with the exception of the build success rate , which is negative at Accenture . In the final column , we combine estimates across experiments ( taking the precision- weighted average across our three experiment-by-experiment estimates ) to get the most precise estimate of the effect of the coding assistance tool.12 While standard errors are consistently large and the effect sizes differ across the three different companies , we find evidence of productivity-enhancing effects of GitHub Copilot : on average , the number of weekly pull requests made by developers increases by 26.08 % ( SE : 10.3 % ) , the number of weekly commits increases by 13.55 % ( SE : 10.0 % ) , and the number of weekly builds increases by 38.38 % ( SE : 12.55 % ) .

Before moving on , we discuss an additional experiment run at Accenture ( not ex- hibited in the above table ) that was abandoned due to a large layoff affecting 42 % of participants , resulting in a lack of data on Copilot usage ( and hence adoption status ) . Because of these data quality issues , we relegate this experiment to Appendix D. How- 10We do not take logs because of a large number of person-weeks that are zero for each variable . How- ever , we report results from a Poisson difference-in-differences regression in Appendix A . 11We relegate unweighted results ( which are less precise ) to Appendix A . 12Thus , \u02c6\u03b2Pooled = ( cid:0 ) \u2211e\u2208E 1/ \u02c6\u03c32 e where E = { Microsoft , Accenture , Anon .

The estimates on the number of commits 43.04 % ( SE : 38.8 % ) and builds 12.33 % ( SE : 53.6 % ) are both positive , though also not statistically significant . The combined results do not change much when we include this second Accenture experiment : the number of pull requests made by developers increases by 21.34 % ( SE : 9.92 % ) , the num- ber of commits increases by 15.39 % ( SE : 9.69 % ) , and the number of builds increases by 37.03 % ( SE : 12.22 % ) . 5 Heterogeneity Previous literature has noted that productivity enhancements driven by large language models are heterogeneous across skill level and education . In particular , in the context of customer service and professional writing tasks , large language models have been found to help the least educated , least skilled workers the most ( Brynjolfsson , Li , and Raymond 2023 ; Noy and Zhang 2023 ) . In scientific and entrepreneurial contexts , however , the most productive workers have been found to benefit more ( Otis et al . 2024 ; Toner-Rodgers 2024 ) . Because we have access to developer characteristics for the Microsoft experiment , we can contribute to this open question in the literature . In particular , we now break out results by ( i ) the tenure , ( ii ) the level , and ( iii ) the pre-experiment productivity of employees at Microsoft13 . We split developers into short and long tenure based on the median observed tenure in our data.14 Any developers that have been with Microsoft for less than the median time at the start of the experiment are considered \u201c short tenure , \u201d and all other developers \u201c long tenure. \u201d Similarly , we split developers into \u201c junior \u201d and `` senior '' based on the level at which they are employed at"}]}

Finally , we split developers into \u201c low pre-productivity \u201d and \u201c high pre- productivity \u201d based on the number of pre-experiment pull requests we observe from them ( using the median as the cutoff . ) We begin our analysis by considering the heterogeneity in adoption patterns in Figure 3 . We see that short-tenure developers are 9.4 percentage points ( SE : 2.2pp ) more likely to adopt Copilot by the end of our sample period ( 81.6 % vs 72.1 % ) , consistent with prior research suggesting that younger workers ( who naturally have lower tenure on average ) are more likely to adopt new technologies ( Meyer 2011 ) . The same effect is at play for the junior developers , who are 4.7 percentage points ( SE : 2.2pp ) more likely to adopt ( 79.2 % vs. 74.4 % ) , though the adoption difference is slightly smaller in this dimension . Intriguingly , low pre-productivity developers are initially more likely to adopt , but this changes soon after the Control group is allowed to adopt , and by the end of our sample , high pre-productivity are slightly more likely to adopt . The next figure , Figure 4 , reveals that employees of shorter tenure are more likely to continue using Copilot more than one month after initial adoption , suggesting that they 13We measure level as of March 1st , 2023 , which is the earliest date available in our data . 14As it is considered sensitive information , we can not reveal the exact median tenure , but it is between 2 and 4 years .

We show event studies that detail the extensive margin , i.e. , how likely a developer is to have used Copilot at all a given number of months after adopting Copilot ; short-tenure developers are more likely to stick with Copilot .

Judging by Figure 4 ( b ) , this effect does not seem present when comparing junior to senior developers . Figure 4 ( c ) shows that , if anything , low-productivity developers are less likely to continue using Copilot , though the difference is ( just ) not statistically significant ( p=.085 ) . Finally , Figure 5 reveals that higher-tenure developers are approxi- mately 4.3 % ( or 1.0 percentage points ) less likely to accept code suggested by Copilot . When comparing junior to senior developers , this difference in acceptance rates is much smaller at 1.8 % ( or 0.5 percentage points ) , though it goes in the same direction of senior developers being less likely to accept AI suggestions . Intriguingly , there is a much larger difference across pre-productivity levels : developers who were less productive before the experiment are significantly more likely to accept any given suggestion . Moving on towards output measures in Figure 6 , we see that the productivity-enhancing effects of Copilot are stronger for lower tenure and more junior developers . While our estimates are noisy and not statistically significant at conventional levels , the pattern is the same across all three main outcome measures : short-tenure developers increase their output by 27 % to 39 % while long-tenure developers have smaller gains of 8 % to 13 % . However , we note that because of our emphasis on the average effect of initially adopting Copilot and the patterns in Figure 4 ( a ) , the estimates for longer-tenure developers may be attenuated by a larger extent of developers abandoning the technology after an initial trial phase . Still , there is no difference in usage conditional on adoption between junior and senior developers in Figure 4 ( b ) , and still we see in 6 ( b ) that junior developers in- crease their output by 21 % to 40 % while senior developers have more marginal gains of 7 % to 16 % . The estimates for above and below-median productivity developers are even noisier but directionally consistent . 6 Conclusion To summarize"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ", we find that usage of a generative AI code suggestion tool increases software developer productivity by 26.08 % ( SE : 10.3 % ) . We note that this estimate is sub- stantially smaller than the 58 % decrease Peng et al . ( 2023 ) find for the time to complete a software engineering task in the lab ( which would correspond to almost twice as many tasks done in a given amount of time ) . It is perhaps unsurprising that the effect of the tool in real-world contexts is smaller than in the lab , since some types of coding tasks may be less readily assisted by Copilot . Additionally , coding is only part of a software developer \u2019 s job , so only some of the time saved on coding tasks may be spent on addi- tional coding . Our estimate is based on observing , partly over the years , the output of almost five thousand software developers at three different companies as part of their regular job , which strongly supports its external validity .

Hence , we use the difference in adoption across the control and treatment groups by a given date as our weight . This matters most for the Microsoft experiment , in which the control group adopted at an elevated rate when its access was granted in March 2023 . For this experiment , we put extra weight on the period just before the control group was allowed to adopt Copilot . 0.1.2.3.4WeightJan 22Jul 22Jan 23Jul 23Jan 24Jul 24Date0.1.2.3.4.5WeightJan 23Apr 23Jul 23Oct 23Jan 24Apr 24Date0.2.4.6WeightJul 22Oct 22Jan 23Apr 23Jul 23Oct 23Jan 24Apr 24Date B Data Cleaning We provide details on which individuals we had to exclude from each raw dataset and the reasons for their exclusion . B.1 Microsoft In the original sample of the dataset , we have 1,746 individuals . We kept only software engineers , which leaves us 1,538 , and we dropped people who switched organizations , leaving us 1,522 . Finally , we dropped one individual who adopted before the experiment started , with a final sample of 1,521 . We also drop the data for the last week of the dataset since the dataset does not record the full week of activity for the last week . Finally , note that while the restriction for the control group was lifted in April 2023 , ten individuals in the control group adopted before that date . We include these individ- uals in our regressions , and they naturally weaken the strength of the instrument . B.2 Accenture We drop individuals who have no record of data and people who left the company . We start with the original dataset with 369 individuals , and after dropping individuals with no outcome measure found we are left with 320 , and after dropping individuals who left the company we are left with a final sample of 316 . Finally , we note that while individuals in the control group were allowed to adopt starting December 2023 , there was one individual in the control group who adopted in October 2023 . We include this individual in our regressions . B.3 Anonymous Company The original sample has 3,054 individuals . We drop individuals who have shown/adopted before they were given access and are left with a final sample of 3,030 individuals .

For each measure , we present its mean and standard deviation in the control group and in the treatment group . We also show the mean difference across these groups and the p-value associated with an underlying test of differences in means . The differences in p-values are calculated using standard errors clustered at the level of treatment assignment . D The First Accenture Experiment We do not discuss at length in the main text another experiment that was run by Accen- ture in April 2023 and included a number of Accenture offices located in Southeast Asia . This experiment was abandoned by the company after Accenture laid off 19,000 employ- ees that some month ( cnn.com ) , including 42 % of the developers participating in this experiment . Still , this attrition was balanced across treatment and control , and we can thus subset to the 204 developers who were not let go for our analysis ; indeed , Table 4 confirms that after this subsetting , treatment and control are still balanced . The problem emerges because Microsoft did not log all Copilot usage data for this experiment , as the company considered it abandoned . In particular , we lack adoption data for the control group until October \u2019 23 . Without this adoption data , any analysis is potentially biased . Still , because our initial analysis revealed that this experiment was the only exper- iment across the three in which we have a negative ( though statistically insignificant ) point estimate for Copilot \u2019 s effect on productivity , we proceed to analyze this experiment in this appendix by imputing that nobody in the Control group adopts Copilot until Oc- tober \u2019 23 , yielding the adoption path in Figure 10 . Thus , in the worst-case scenario , it could be that all the adoptions that we attribute to October 2023 already happened right at the beginning of the experiment . This data quality concern means our treatment effect estimates will be conservative ( as we may mistakenly count up to 10 % of the control group as non-adopters during half of the sampling period . ) Keeping in mind this caveat that our treatment effect estimates are potentially conser- vative , we report the results from this first Accenture experiment in Table 5 . We find a negative point estimate of -39.18 % ( SE : 36.78 % ) on the number of tasks completed . Still , this estimate has a high degree of statistical uncertainty , and we note that the estimates on the number of commits 43.04 % ( SE : 38.8"}]}
